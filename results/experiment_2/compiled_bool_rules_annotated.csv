In particular, the rule might also be that any yellow object or any medium object or any triangle is 'True', and there is currently no way to distinguish between these possibilities.

38,hg01,True,small yellow circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' appears to be that the object must be any size (small, medium, large), any color (yellow, green, blue), and any shape (triangle, circle, rectangle). There are no objects labeled as 'False', which suggests that there may not be a specific exclusion rule, or simply that no examples of 'False' have been provided.

16,hg06,circle or blue,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule likely involves both shape and color. For an object to be labeled 'True', it must be either blue in color, regardless of shape or size, or it must be a large or medium circle of any color. Group 2 confirms this since the large yellow triangle does not fit either criterion and is therefore labeled 'False', while the medium blue circle is labeled 'True'. Group 3 reiterates that yellow triangles, regardless of size, are 'False'. Group 5 supports the idea that any blue object, whether a triangle, circle, or rectangle, and irrespective of size, is labeled 'True'.

40,hg08,blue or green,medium blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for an object to be labeled 'True' seems to be that it must either be green in color or be a triangle or rectangle. Objects that do not follow these conditions are labeled 'False'.

The color green appears to be universally accepted, as all green objects, regardless of their shape (circle, rectangle, or triangle), have been labeled 'True'. Additionally, while blue and yellow colored objects have been labeled both 'True' and 'False', it appears that this is governed by their shape, with rectangles and triangles being 'True' and circles being 'False', unless the circles are green, which overrides the shape rule. This indicates that the color green is dominant in the rule hierarchy. Large, medium, and small sizes are all accepted, indicating that size is not a factor in the rule.

5. Any size, except for triangles and non-green, non-blue, non-yellow colors (regardless of shape and size), can be labeled 'True'.

Triangles are always labeled 'False', independent of size and color (as seen in Group 8 and Group 15, for example), and green is a common color for 'True' shapes. The 'True' label applies to green circles of any size and rectangles of any color (as in Group 9 and Group 14), but blue and yellow circles must be medium or large to be true, as small ones are false (as seen in Group 6 and Group 13).

For Group 16:

-large yellow rectangle -> False (Rectangles are labeled 'True' for any size and color.)
-medium yellow triangle -> False (All triangles are labeled 'False', regardless of size and color.)",16,"def is_rule(obj):

1. The object must be a circle.
2. The color of the circle must be either green or yellow.

All 'True' labeled objects are either green or yellow circles (regardless of size), and all objects that are not circles or not green/yellow are labeled 'False'.

2. The object must be blue or yellow in color (green objects are labeled 'False').

Shapes do not affect the rule as there are triangles, circles, and rectangles that are both 'True' and 'False'. It is only when these shapes are large or green that they are labeled 'False'. Therefore:

2. The object is a large yellow shape (triangle, rectangle, circle).
3. The object is a medium or small green rectangle.

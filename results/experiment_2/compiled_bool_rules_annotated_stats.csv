The color green appears to be universally accepted, as all green objects, regardless of their shape (circle, rectangle, or triangle), have been labeled 'True'. Additionally, while blue and yellow colored objects have been labeled both 'True' and 'False', it appears that this is governed by their shape, with rectangles and triangles being 'True' and circles being 'False', unless the circles are green, which overrides the shape rule. This indicates that the color green is dominant in the rule hierarchy. Large, medium, and small sizes are all accepted, indicating that size is not a factor in the rule.

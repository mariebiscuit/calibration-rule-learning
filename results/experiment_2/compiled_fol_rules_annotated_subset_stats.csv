Specifically:

- A medium blue rectangle is 'True' (see Group 14 and Group 15).
- A large yellow rectangle is 'True' (see Group 17 and Group 18).
- A large yellow circle is 'True' (see Group 6).
- A medium yellow circle is 'True' when isolated (see Group 8), but 'False' when accompanied by a small green triangle (see Group 10).
- A large green rectangle is 'True' in Group 17 but was 'False' before, which hints that it may depend on the presence of another object to be 'True'. However, no consistent supporting context is provided.
- A large blue triangle is 'True' (see Group 15), but this may be incidental rather than a defining part of the rule, due to the inconsistency with the rule and need for more evidence which is not available.

- A medium blue rectangle is 'True' (see Group 14 and Group 15).
- A large yellow rectangle is 'True' (see Group 17 and Group 18).

- A medium yellow circle is 'True' when isolated (see Group 8), but 'False' when accompanied by a small green triangle (see Group 10).
- A large green rectangle is 'True' in Group 17 but was 'False' before, which hints that it may depend on the presence of another object to be 'True'. However, no consistent supporting context is provided.
- A large blue triangle is 'True' (see Group 15), but this may be incidental rather than a defining part of the rule, due to the inconsistency with the rule and need for more evidence which is not available.

The rule seems to be: an object is labeled 'True' if it is any size of blue object, or if it is a rectangle of any color other than green. Objects that do not meet these criteria are labeled 'False'.

Here are the labels for Group 19 according to this rule:

An object is labeled 'True' if it is either small and green, regardless of its shape, or if it is not green and its shape matches the size indicated (for example, medium blue triangle is 'True' because 'medium' and 'triangle' match). No large objects are 'True' unless they are green triangles.

Shape does not seem to be a consistent factor, as there are both true and false labels for different shapes in blue and yellow. Thus, the rule seems to be: an object is labeled 'True' if it is medium or large and is either blue or yellow.

- large yellow rectangle
- medium yellow circle
- large yellow circle
- small green triangle

So the rule could be related to both color and shape, but not size, as we have both large and medium circles and a small triangle. Looking at these, the common characteristic is that each 'True' object contains yellow color, except for the small green Triangle, which doesn't contain the color yellow. However, there are other yellow objects labeled 'False,' so there must be another condition. Given that the only 'True' items that contain yellow are circles and not all yellow circles are labeled 'True,' there's also possibly an exception for one triangle, it's difficult to pinpoint one consistent rule from the given data.

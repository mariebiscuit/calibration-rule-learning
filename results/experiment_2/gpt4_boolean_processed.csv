0,2,hg11,not (circle and blue),medium blue circle,False,,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to depend on the size and color of the objects: an object must be large and blue to be labeled 'True'. Shape does not appear to be relevant, as various shapes are labeled as 'True' as long as they meet the size and color criteria. Any object that is not large and blue is labeled 'False'. Now let's label the objects in Group 1:

-large green triangle -> False
-small green rectangle -> False
-medium blue a circle -> False","def is_rule(obj):
    return obj.large and obj.blue",large and blue,False,,True,False
1,6,hg11,not (circle and blue),large green rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is that an object must be either green in color or a large triangle.

Labeling for Group 3:
-large green rectangle -> True
-large yellow triangle -> True
-small blue circle -> False","def is_rule(obj):
    return obj.green or (obj.large and obj.triangle)",green or (large and triangle),True,1.0,True,False

An object is labeled 'True' if and only if it is a triangle or a circle and yellow or green in color, and either medium-sized or large, while small yellow or green triangles and circles are labeled 'False'. No considerations are made based on shape or color for blue objects or rectangles; they are always labeled 'False'.

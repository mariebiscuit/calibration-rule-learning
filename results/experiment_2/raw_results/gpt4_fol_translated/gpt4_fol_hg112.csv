An object is labeled 'True' if and only if the following condition is met: if the object is blue, it must be a triangle or rectangle; if the object is yellow, it must be a circle or rectangle; if the object is green, it must be a circle. No other shapes are labeled 'True' for green objects, and triangles or circles in colors other than blue, yellow, or green are labeled 'False'. Additionally, green rectangles, yellow triangles, and blue circles are always labeled 'False'. Size does not seem to play a role in the rule.

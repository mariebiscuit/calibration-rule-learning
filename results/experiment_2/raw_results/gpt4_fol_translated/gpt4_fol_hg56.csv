67,67,hg56,unique largest (blue or green) object,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' appears to be related to specific combinations of size, color, and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it's a medium blue circle, a small green circle, a large green circle, a large blue triangle, a small blue triangle, a small green rectangle, a medium green rectangle, a medium blue rectangle, or a medium green triangle. All other combinations are labeled 'False'.

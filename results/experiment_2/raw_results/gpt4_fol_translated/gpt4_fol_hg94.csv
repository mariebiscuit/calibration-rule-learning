Since there is no positive example to compare against, it is not possible to determine what specific attributes (color, size, shape) would result in an object being labeled 'True'. All objects across various groups with different combinations of attributes (color, size, shape) have consistently been labeled as 'False'.

Since there is no affirmative instance to suggest what might constitute a 'True' label, the most straightforward and consistent rule that can be inferred is that all objects, regardless of their color, shape, or size, should be labeled 'False'.

If an object is green and small, it is labeled 'True'. If an object is not green and small or is medium regardless of color, it should be labeled 'False'. The rule does not seem to consider the shape of the objects, only their size and green color attribute.

All objects that have been labeled 'True' are green and are either circles or triangles. No rectangles or objects of any other color have been labeled 'True'. This means that objects that are green and either circles or triangles should be labeled 'True', whereas all other objects, including any rectangles or objects that are not green, should be labeled 'False'.

Following this rule, the labels for the objects in Group 25 would be:

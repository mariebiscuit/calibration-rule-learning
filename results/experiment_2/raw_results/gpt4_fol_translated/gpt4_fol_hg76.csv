66,66,hg76,every other object   shares at least one feature  with this object,large yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is based on the following criteria: an object must be medium in size AND must be either a yellow circle, a green circle, a green triangle, or a yellow rectangle; OR an object must be large in size AND be either a blue circle, a green circle, or a blue triangle. No other combinations, regardless of color, shape, or size, are labeled 'True'.

Now, let's label all the following objects in Group 23:
-large blue circle -> True (because it's large and blue circle)
-large yellow rectangle -> False (because it's not a blue circle, green circle, or blue triangle)
-large yellow circle -> False (because it's not a blue circle, green circle, or blue triangle)","def is_rule(obj):

67,67,hg76,every other object   shares at least one feature  with this object,small yellow triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the labeling rule appears to be based on the size and color of the objects. Specifically, objects are labeled 'True' if they are either medium and green, medium and yellow, or large and blue, regardless of their shape. All other combinations are labeled 'False'.

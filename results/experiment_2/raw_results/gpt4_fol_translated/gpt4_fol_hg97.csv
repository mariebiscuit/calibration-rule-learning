Objects that do not meet all of these criteria should be labeled 'False'.

The rule is: an object is labeled 'True' if it is a small blue shape (regardless of the type of shape) or a medium yellow rectangle. All other objects are labeled 'False'. This rule is consistent with all previously labeled objects.

All other characteristics result in an object being labeled 'False'.

Now I will label the objects in Group 14 based on the discovered rule:

An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a triangle of any color or size, or any shape that is blue, regardless of the size. Any other objects that do not meet this criteria are labeled 'False'.

Now, I will label the objects in Group 13 as follows:
-small blue triangle-> True (because it's blue)

Specifically, a shape must be paired with a particular color to be labeled 'True':

- Triangles are 'True' if they are yellow or blue, regardless of their size.
- Circles are 'True' if they are blue, regardless of their size.
- Rectangles are 'True' if they are blue and medium-sized.

71,71,hg73,there is another object of the same shape and another object of the same color,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be based on the combination of their size, shape, and color. The pattern is that an object is labeled 'True' if it is large and yellow or if it is any size of blue rectangle. Medium yellow circles and small yellow triangles do not match the established rule, so they would be labeled as 'False'.

For Group 25 based on the rule:

-small yellow triangle -> False","def is_rule(obj):
    return (obj.large and obj.yellow) or (obj.blue and obj.rectangle)",(large and yellow) or (blue and rectangle),False,0.6714285714285714,True,False,25

The objects that are labeled 'True' are all circles, and they are either large blue circles or small blue circles. However, the group does not allow for medium blue circles to be labeled 'True'. Other shapes, sizes, or colors, even if they are blue, do not follow this rule and are labeled 'False'. The rule can be summarized as follows: an object is labeled 'True' if and only if it is a circle that is either large and blue or small and blue.

The size seems to either be small or large, but not medium, and the color should be blue. It doesn't seem to matter what shape the objects are, as long as they fit the size and color criteria.

Applying this understanding to Group 23:

All other objects, regardless of their size, shape, or color, should be labeled as 'False'.

All medium-sized objects are labeled 'False', as well as any object that is not blue, regardless of its size or shape.

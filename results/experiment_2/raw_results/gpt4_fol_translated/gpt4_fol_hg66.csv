0,0,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' involves identifying if an object is a medium red circle. If an object is a medium red circle, it should be labeled 'True'. All other objects, regardless of their color, size, or shape, should be labeled 'False'.

For an object to be labeled 'True', it must be blue or yellow, and it must be a circle, triangle, or rectangle. Other colors or shapes, such as green objects or objects with shapes that are not circles, triangles, or rectangles, are labeled 'False'.

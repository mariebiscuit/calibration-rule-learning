0,0,hg104,exactly one other object   is the same color,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' is related to whether an object is a large blue circle. If an object is a large blue circle, it is labeled 'True'. All other objects, regardless of their color, size, or shape, are labeled 'False'.

Now to label the object in Group 1 following this rule:

1,1,hg104,exactly one other object   is the same color,large green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' or 'False' cannot be definitively determined from a single example. With only one object labeled 'False' and no objects labeled 'True', there is insufficient information to establish a pattern or rule based on color, size, shape, or other factors. Therefore, without additional examples to compare, I cannot accurately label the objects in Group 2. Additional information is required to deduce the secret rule.

Despite this, here is an attempt to label the objects in Group 2 based on an assumption, which should be taken with caution as it may not align with the actual rule:

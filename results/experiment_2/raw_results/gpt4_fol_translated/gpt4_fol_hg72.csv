0,0,hg72,same shape as another object that is blue,medium yellow triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects involves them being medium sized yellow shapes. Thus, the objects are labeled 'True' if they are medium, yellow, and any shape (the shape doesn't seem to matter as long as they meet the color and size criteria).

However, with the information given (medium yellow triangle -> False), we do not have enough data to determine a pattern or rule. We need additional examples of objects that are labeled 'True' to determine what makes an object comply with the underlying rule.

Since we must attempt to label the objects in Group 2 without a discernible rule, I can only guess based on the single example given:

-medium green triangle -> False
-small blue rectangle -> False

There are no 'True' labeled objects to discern a pattern from just 'False' labels. Since no positive examples have been provided, and no consistent attribute can be concluded from the negative examples alone (differing in size, color, and shape), I cannot confidently establish a rule.

Therefore, without further information or 'True' examples, I will have to tentatively label the objects in Group 3 as follows:

An object is labeled 'True' if it fits the following conditions: a colored shape must be either medium blue or large yellow to be labeled 'True'. This rule is consistent with all provided labels. Specifically:

- A medium blue rectangle is 'True' (see Group 14 and Group 15).
- A large yellow rectangle is 'True' (see Group 17 and Group 18).
- A large yellow circle is 'True' (see Group 6).
- A medium yellow circle is 'True' when isolated (see Group 8), but 'False' when accompanied by a small green triangle (see Group 10).
- A large green rectangle is 'True' in Group 17 but was 'False' before, which hints that it may depend on the presence of another object to be 'True'. However, no consistent supporting context is provided.
- A large blue triangle is 'True' (see Group 15), but this may be incidental rather than a defining part of the rule, due to the inconsistency with the rule and need for more evidence which is not available.
- Large blue rectangles, medium green circles, and small blue triangles are always 'False'.

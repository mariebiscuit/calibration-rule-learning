65,65,hg75,there is another object of the same shape<br>that is the same color as another different object,medium yellow triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule to label the objects correctly relies on a combination of their shape and color, with no consideration for size. The objects are labeled 'True' if they are triangles or if they are rectangles that are not green. All circles and green rectangles are labeled 'False'. This rule is consistent with all the provided labels across the different groups.

Applying this rule to Group 22:

66,66,hg75,there is another object of the same shape<br>that is the same color as another different object,medium blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be related to having a combination of either a medium-sized object or a small-sized blue object, as well as any green triangle. Therefore, rectangles that are medium-sized, blue triangles of any size, and green triangles of any size should be labeled 'True'. All other objects, including those that do not fit the size and color criteria, should be labeled 'False'.

69,69,hg75,there is another object of the same shape<br>that is the same color as another different object,small blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that an object must be both small and blue, or it must be a triangle, or both. Size doesn't seem to matter for triangles; all triangles are labeled 'True' regardless of their size or color. Any object that is not a small blue shape or any triangle is labeled 'False'.

Additionally, only certain combinations of these criteria result in 'True': for instance, medium green rectangles are 'True', regardless of their common 'green' exclusion.

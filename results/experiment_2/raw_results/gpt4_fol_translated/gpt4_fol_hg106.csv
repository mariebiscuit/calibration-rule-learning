Looking at the patterns, the label 'True' is assigned to:

1. Large green rectangles.
2. Small green triangles.
3. Yellow rectangles of any size (both medium and large sizes have been labeled as 'True').

No other combination of size, color, and shape has consistently been labeled 'True'. Triangles that are not small and green or rectangles that are not large and green or of any size in yellow are labeled 'False'. Additionally, neither circles nor blue objects, regardless of their size or shape, have been labeled as 'True'.

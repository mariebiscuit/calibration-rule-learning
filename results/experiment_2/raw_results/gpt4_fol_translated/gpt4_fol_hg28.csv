Now, let's label the objects in Group 20:

- Small yellow objects are labeled 'True' (as seen in Group 9 and Group 20).
- Green objects are labeled 'True' only if they are both large and circles or if they are rectangles (any size, as seen in Groups 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, and 16).
- Blue objects are labeled 'True' only if they are medium circles, large circles, or rectangles (any size, as seen in Groups 1, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, and 17).
- Yellow objects are labeled 'True' if they are large triangles or circles (as seen in Groups 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, and 20).

Using this rule, the labels for the objects in Group 21 should be:
-small green circle -> False (not large and a circle)

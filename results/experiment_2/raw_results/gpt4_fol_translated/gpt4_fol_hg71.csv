The rule is that an object must be yellow and rectangular to be labeled 'True'. Other colors or shapes should be labeled 'False'.

Now, I will label the objects in Group 1:

Specifically, objects seem to be labeled 'True' when they meet the following criteria:
- For yellow objects, they must be either rectangles or triangles.
- For blue objects, they must be either circles or rectangles.
- For green objects, they must be either circles or rectangles.

Other shapes and color combinations are labeled 'False'. Additionally, there does not seem to be any size discrimination for these labels; objects of all sizes can be 'True' as long as they follow the color and shape rule.

Given this rule, the objects in Group 23 should be labeled as follows:

Triangles and rectangles, regardless of their size, are labeled True. Color does not seem to be a limiting factor as green, yellow, and blue shapes are labeled True. However, circles are labeled False, as seen with the large yellow circle.

Therefore, the rule is: all shapes are True unless they're circles that are not medium green or small yellow.

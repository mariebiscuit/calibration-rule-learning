2,2,hg101,same shape as a uniquely smallest object,medium yellow triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to require the object to be yellow in color, irrespective of its size or shape. The color is the only consistent attribute since both a small triangle and a large rectangle that are yellow are labeled 'True'.

1. Small objects are always labeled 'True', regardless of color or shape.
2. Medium and large objects are labeled 'True' if they are the same color and a different shape from any other object within their group with a 'False' label.

For Group 23:
-medium green triangle -> False (because there is a medium green circle with 'True' in Group 19 and shape is not used to determine 'True' for medium/large objects)

1. Small shapes are always labeled 'True'.
2. For medium and large shapes, the rule appears to be as follows:
   - 'True' for medium or large shapes that are yellow rectangles.
   - 'True' for medium shapes that are circles, regardless of color.
   - 'True' for large blue shapes, regardless of shape.
   - 'False' for all large shapes that are neither yellow rectangles nor blue shapes.
   - 'False' for medium shapes that are not yellow rectangles or circles.

- Small triangles are always labeled 'True', regardless of color. 
- Large triangles, circles, and rectangles are labeled 'True' as well, but only if they are either green, yellow, or blue. 
- Medium-sized objects and small circles, rectangles, and objects of colors other than green, yellow, or blue are labeled 'False'.

It's worth noting that once a shape is labeled 'True' with a specific color, all subsequent instances of that shape and color appear to also be labeled 'True'. 

Let's label the objects in Group 19:

-medium green circle -> False (previously, small and large green circles were labeled 'False')
-small green rectangle -> True (green rectangles have been labeled 'True' before)
-large green triangle -> True (green triangles have been labeled 'True' before)","def is_rule(obj):

66,66,hg111,at least one other object of the same shape is the same color,large green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule seems to depend on the shape and color of the objects, but not on their size. Specifically, the rule appears to be that any object is labeled 'True' if it is a shape that has previously been labeled 'True' with the same color. If the shape has not been labeled 'True' with the same color before, then it is labeled 'False'. For example, blue rectangles and circles are 'True', while blue triangles are 'False'. Yellow circles are 'True'; however, yellow triangles and rectangles are 'False'. Green rectangles and triangles are 'True', while green circles are 'False'.

An object is labeled 'True' if it fits the following criteria:

- For rectangles: They are 'True' if they are either medium green, small blue, or small green.
- For triangles: They are 'true' if they are small, regardless of their color.
- For circles: They are 'True' if they are either large blue, large yellow, large green or small yellow.

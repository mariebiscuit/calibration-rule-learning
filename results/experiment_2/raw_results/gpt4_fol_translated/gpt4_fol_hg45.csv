0,0,hg45,same shape as one of the largest,large green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must be large and green, regardless of its shape. All objects that do not meet both criteria should be labeled as 'False'.

4,4,hg45,same shape as one of the largest,large blue triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to involve being both small and any shape or color, or being a green triangle of any size. The objects that are 'True' are either small triangles of any color, small circles of any color, or large green triangles.

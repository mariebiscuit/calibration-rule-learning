An object is labeled as 'True' if it is a blue shape or a large rectangle, and 'False' for any other combination of color and shape.

Other shapes that are green are labeled 'False'.

For Group 4:
-small blue circle -> True","def is_rule(obj):
    return obj.blue or (obj.green and obj.rectangle)",blue or (green and rectangle),True,0.7,True,False,4
11,11,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be dependent on the color of the objects. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue or green, regardless of its size or shape. Objects with any colors other than blue or green are not provided, so the rule doesn't account for them. However, since no yellow objects have been labeled yet with either 'True' or 'False', it's slightly speculative but consistent with the given data to assume non-blue/green objects would be labeled 'False'.

Labeling for Group 5:
-large yellow triangle -> False","def is_rule(obj):

12,12,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,large green rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects true or false seems to be based on the shape of the object and its color, but not on its size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is any shape that is either blue or green. The only false objects in the examples are a green triangle and a yellow triangle, which suggests that triangles are the exception unless they are blue or green (the green triangle in Group 1 may have been erroneously labeled as False, as it does not fit with the consistency of the rule observed with other green items). Yellow objects are labeled 'False' regardless of their shape or size, as seen with the large yellow triangle in Group 5. 

Given this rule:

-large green rectangle -> True","def is_rule(obj):

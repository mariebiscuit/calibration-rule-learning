The color doesn't seem to be relevant as long as the object is a triangle and meets the size criterion—small triangles and medium blue triangles are 'True', while medium green and small green triangles are 'False', possibly because of their color since the only triangles labeled 'True' were either blue or not green. Large Green circles are also 'False' which suggests that size alone (void of color or shape) doesn't determine the label.

Now to label the objects in Group 14:
-small green triangle -> False (it fits the triangle part of the rule but small green triangles have been labeled 'False')
-medium blue triangle -> True (medium blue triangles were consistently labeled 'True')","def is_rule(obj):

43,43,hg62,blue and same shape as another object,medium green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that they must be triangles that are either small blue triangles or medium blue triangles, or they must be large blue circles. All other objects should be labeled as 'False' regardless of their size, color, or shape. Therefore, the objects in Group 15 should be labeled as follows:

-medium green triangle -> False

46,46,hg62,blue and same shape as another object,medium yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is based on both the shape and size of the object. An object is labeled 'True' if it is a triangle and is either small or large, but not medium. Additionally, the rule does not seem to be influenced by the color of the objects, as triangles of various colors have been labeled 'True.'

Therefore, for Group 16:
-medium yellow triangle-> False","def is_rule(obj):

47,47,hg62,blue and same shape as another object,medium yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is based on a combination of the shape and the size of the object. Specifically, the rule seems to be: an object is labeled 'True' if it is both blue and a triangle, regardless of its size. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Label the objects in Group 17 accordingly:

- Triangles that are blue and medium are labeled 'True'.
- Triangles that are blue and small are labeled 'True' only if there's no large blue rectangle in the same group.

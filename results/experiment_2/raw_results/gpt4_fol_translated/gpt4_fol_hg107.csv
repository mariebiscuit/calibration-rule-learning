An object is labeled 'True' if it is either (1) a blue shape (regardless of size and shape, whether circle, rectangle, or triangle) or (2) a triangle of any color (green, blue, or yellow). No yellow or green circles, rectangles, or small triangles were labeled 'True'. Additionally, no large shapes of colors other than blue are marked as 'True'.

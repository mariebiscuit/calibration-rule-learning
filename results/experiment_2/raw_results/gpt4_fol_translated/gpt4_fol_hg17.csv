An object is labeled 'True' if it is not a rectangle and/or if its color is yellow. In all the labeled examples, rectangles are only labeled 'True' if they are yellow. All other shapes (triangles, circles) are labeled 'True' regardless of their color, and all yellow objects, regardless of shape, are labeled 'True'.

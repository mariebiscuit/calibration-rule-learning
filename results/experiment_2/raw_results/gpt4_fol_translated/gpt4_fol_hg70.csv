0,0,hg70,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium blue triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to depend on the object being the largest blue shape in the group. An object is labeled 'True' if it is the largest blue shape amongst the objects, considering both size and color (but not shape), and labeled 'False' if it is not the largest blue shape or if it is not blue at a given size. This rule is consistent with all previous examples.

Label the following object in Group 1:
- medium blue triangle -> True","def is_rule(obj):

1,1,hg70,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that an object must be a medium blue triangle. Objects that do not conform to being both medium-sized and blue triangles should be labeled 'False'.

If an object is not a triangle, then the label 'True' is given to green objects of any shape, yellow circles, and small blue objects of any shape; all other non-triangles are labeled 'False'.

Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following criteria: 

1. Any triangle that is blue or yellow.
2. Any circle that is blue or yellow.
3. Any rectangle that is green.
4. Any circle that is green, but it should be medium-sized.

This rule is consistent with all the provided examples. Now, I will label the object in Group 25:

-medium green circle -> False (it does not meet the medium-size criterion for green circles).","def is_rule(obj):

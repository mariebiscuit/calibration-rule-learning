0,0,hg01,True,medium yellow triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to involve the object being a small blue circle. All other objects, regardless of their color, size, or shape, are labeled as 'False'. Therefore, I will label the object in Group 1 as follows:

- medium yellow triangle -> False","def is_rule(obj):

1,1,hg01,True,small yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule might be that an object is labeled 'True' if it is a medium yellow triangle. However, with only one example to go from, this rule is quite speculative and may not be accurate. In particular, the rule might also be that any yellow object or any medium object or any triangle is 'True', and there is currently no way to distinguish between these possibilities.

In other words, if an object has been labeled 'True' in previous groups, then it continues to be labeled 'typeof(undefined)', regardless of group composition.

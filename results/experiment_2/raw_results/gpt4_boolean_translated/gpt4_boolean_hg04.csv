0,0,hg04,circle,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' involves evaluating the shape and the color of the objects. Objects labeled 'True' are all circles, and they are either red, yellow, or patterned with multiple colors. Size does not seem to impact the truth value. Therefore, the rule is likely: ""The object must be a circle and have an accepted color (red, yellow, or multicolored) to be labeled 'True'."" Non-circles, or circles of any colors not previously mentioned, should be labeled 'False'.

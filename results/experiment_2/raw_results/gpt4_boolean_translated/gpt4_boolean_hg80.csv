The objects labeled as 'True' are those that are blue of any shade, any green shapes except for circles, or yellow shapes that are rectangles or triangles. All other objects that do not meet these criteria are labeled 'False'—specifically, any green circles, yellow circles, and objects of different colors and shapes not included in the 'True' criteria above.

For Group 24, the objects would be labeled as follows:
-medium blue rectangle -> True
-large green triangle -> True","def is_rule(obj):
    return (obj.blue) or ((obj.green and not obj.circle) or (obj.yellow and (obj.rectangle or obj.triangle)))",(blue) or ((green and not circle) or (yellow and (rectangle or triangle))),True,1.0,True,False,24

All other shapes (triangle, rectangle) are labeled 'True' regardless of color, and circles are only labeled 'True' if they are blue. Green circles and yellow circles are always labeled 'False'.

Labels for Group 25:
-large blue circle -> True","def is_rule(obj):

74,74,hg21,large or small,large yellow circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is based on the size and color of the objects. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either large or the color blue, regardless of its shape. An object is labeled 'False' if it is medium-sized or a color other than blue, unless the object is either green and circle-shaped or yellow and triangle-shaped (these exceptions will still be labeled 'True'). Now to label the objects in Group 24:

-large yellow circle -> True (because it is large, the rule for ""large"" overrides other considerations)
-large blue rectangle -> True (because it is large and blue)
-medium green triangle -> False (because it is medium and the exception for green does not apply to triangles)

Therefore, medium-sized blue objects are the only exception to the rule where they are labeled 'False' even though they are blue.

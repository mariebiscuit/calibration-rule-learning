The rule appears to be: An object should be labeled 'True' if it is a blue square or a green circle. All other combinations of shapes and colors should be labeled 'False'.

3,3,hg19,medium,large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' relies on both the color and shape of the object. An object is labeled 'True' if it is green and has three sides, i.e., a green triangle. Any object that does not fit both criteria is labeled 'False'. Therefore:

4,4,hg19,medium,small blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' revolves around the object being a medium-sized green triangle.

0,hg63,same color as another object,small blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' depends on the number of corners or points they have. Objects with an even number of corners or points (such as squares with four corners) are labeled 'True', while objects with an odd number of corners or points (such as triangles with three corners) are labeled 'False'. Color and size do not seem to affect the labeling. 

Labeling Group 1:
- small blue circle -> False (circles have no corners)
- medium yellow triangle -> False (triangles have three corners, which is odd)"

Both objects in Group 1 are labeled 'False,' but without any 'True' examples or additional context, the rule cannot be determined. Without a clear understanding of the rule, I can only guess at the labels for Group 2. However, to remain consistent with the instructions, here's an attempt to label the objects in Group 2, despite the fact that it is purely speculative:

-medium yellow rectangle -> False

It's important to note that these labels are not necessarily correct and are based on the lack of a clear rule from the initially provided examples. More examples, especially ones labeled 'True,' would be needed to accurately determine the rule."

5,hg63,same color as another object,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is not based on size, as there are various sizes labeled 'False'. The rule is not based on color either, because there are different colors that are all marked 'False'. The rule does not appear to be based on shape, since we have a triangle, rectangle, and circles all labeled 'False'. There is no clear rule based on the given information that distinguishes any object as 'True'. Therefore, by the process of elimination and the lack of any object labeled 'True', I would have to label all objects as 'False' unless otherwise directed with a new rule or example.

An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a triangle or a rectangle of any size, as long as it is not green, or a large circle of any color except yellow. An object is labeled 'False' if it does not meet these criteria.

Label the following objects in Group 15:

- large blue circle -> False (because it's not green)
- medium green circle -> True (because it's a green circle)
- medium yellow rectangle -> True (because it's a yellow rectangle)"

3,hg98,the unique smallest object,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is not clear from the given data. There is insufficient information to determine a consistent pattern or rule because the shapes, sizes, and colors provided don't reveal an obvious connection for their labels, and all objects in Group 1 are labeled 'False'. Without more examples of objects labeled 'True', it is impossible to discern the rule.

Without a discernible rule, the objects in Group 2 will be labeled arbitrarily:

-small yellow triangle -> True (condition 2)
-medium blue rectangle -> True (condition 1)
-small yellow circle -> True (condition 2)
-large blue circle -> False (not meeting any condition)"
57,hg98,the unique smallest object,medium blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to focus on the specific combination of color, size, and shape. Objects are labeled 'True' if they meet the following conditions:

1. The object is a medium-sized blue rectangle.
2. The object is a small yellow triangle or circle.
3. The object is a small green circle.
4. The object is a large blue rectangle.

60,hg98,the unique smallest object,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is if the object is the smallest size of its color and shape combination amongst all objects presented. It does not need to be the only instance of its color and shape, just the smallest.

Now, let's label the following objects in Group 23:

-large yellow rectangle -> False (It is large and there's a small yellow rectangle in Group 16 that is labeled as False, hence the large one cannot be True)
-medium yellow triangle -> False (There is a small yellow triangle labeled as True in Group 9)
-medium yellow circle -> True (There are no other yellow circles presented, so it is the smallest by default)"

63,hg98,the unique smallest object,medium green triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the labeling rule is that an object is labeled 'True' if it is the smallest size (small) variant of its color and shape. For example, small green circles and small yellow triangles are labeled 'True', while larger or medium-sized versions, or other shapes of the same color, are labeled 'False'. It is important to note that blue rectangles and specifically the large blue rectangle, even though there is no small or medium version presented, are also labeled 'True', suggesting that perhaps the rule for blue rectangles is different, or the data is incomplete for this shape and color. However, since there is no small blue rectangle labeled 'True', it could imply that for rectangles, the largest size is labeled 'True'. Yet, there is no consistent evidence to definitively conclude the rule for rectangles since a small blue rectangle and medium blue rectangle are labeled 'False'.

Based on this rule, the label for the object in Group 24 is:
-medium green triangle -> False"
64,hg98,the unique smallest object,medium blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule is based on the size and color, not the shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it's either a:

- Small object of any color except yellow.
- Medium-sized blue object.
- Large blue rectangle specifically.

Using this rule, the labels for the objects in Group 25 should be as follows:
- medium blue rectangle -> True
- medium yellow triangle -> False
- medium yellow rectangle -> False
- large green triangle -> False
- small yellow circle -> True"

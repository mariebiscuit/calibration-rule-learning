No other qualities, such as size or the presence of other shapes or colors, impact whether an object is labeled 'True' or 'False'. If an object is a blue rectangle of any size, it is labeled 'True'; if it does not meet both these criteria, it is labeled 'False'.

Label the objects in Group 23:
-medium yellow rectangle -> False
-medium green triangle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> False

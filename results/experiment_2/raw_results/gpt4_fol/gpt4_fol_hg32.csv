69,hg32,larger than or equal-sized with all objects,small yellow rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be based on both the size and the color of the objects.

1. The object must be large in size.
2. The object must be either green, yellow, or blue.

Any object that does not meet both criteria is labeled 'False'.

Therefore, I will label the object in Group 25 as follows:
-small yellow rectangle -> False"

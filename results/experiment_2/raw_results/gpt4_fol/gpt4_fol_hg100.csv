0,hg100,one of the smallest of objects who share a shape with another object,large blue rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' or 'False' revolves around their shape. The objects labeled 'True' are all circles, regardless of their size or color, while objects of any other shape are labeled 'False'. Consequently, objects that are rectangles or triangles should be labeled 'False'.

Therefore, for Group 1:
- large blue rectangle -> False
- medium green triangle -> False"

47,hg100,one of the smallest of objects who share a shape with another object,large green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' involves the following criteria:

1. The object must not be a large rectangle.
2. If the object is a triangle, it must be either small or medium-sized and any color is acceptable.
3. If the object is a circle, it must be small and yellow.
4. If the object is a small rectangle, it must be blue or yellow.

With this rule in mind, here are the labels for the objects in Group 18:

-small yellow triangle -> True (It's a small triangle)
-small yellow circle -> True (It's a small yellow circle)
-large green triangle -> False (It's large, which does not fit the condition for triangles)
-small blue rectangle -> True (It's a small rectangle and blue)
-medium yellow triangle -> True (It's a medium-sized triangle, which fits the condition for triangles)"

1. The color of the object must be either yellow or blue. Green objects are consistently marked as 'False' if they are large or medium-sized, but small green objects are marked 'True.'
2. Small sized objects are always labeled 'True,' regardless of color, shape, or the presence of other objects in the group.

Size does not matter for yellow objects. Large objects of any other color are labeled 'False,' as well as medium and large blue rectangles specifically, regardless of their color. Green objects are 'True' only if they are not large rectangles. Blue objects are 'True' only if they are small rectangles or triangles.

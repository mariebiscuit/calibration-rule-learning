An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a triangle of any color, a circle of any color, a small object of any shape and color, or a large or medium blue object of any shape. Rectangles are only labeled 'True' if they are not yellow and are small or blue. Otherwise, rectangles, particularly medium or large yellow ones, are labeled 'False'.

The objects labeled as 'True' include all circles, all triangles, and rectangles that are either blue or very small. The only exception to this seems to be the medium yellow rectangle, which has been consistently labeled 'False'. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

An object is labeled 'True' if it is a circle, a triangle, or a small rectangle, or if it is a blue rectangle of any size.
Conversely, an object is labeled 'False' if it is a rectangle that is not blue unless it is very small (i.e. small yellow rectangle), or if it is specifically a medium yellow rectangle.

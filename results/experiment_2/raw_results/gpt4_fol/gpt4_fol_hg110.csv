0,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,large green triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to be based on their color and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a green shape of any kind or a triangle of any size or color. Therefore, the rule seems to be that an object is considered 'True' if it is green or if it is a triangle. Additionally, an object is labeled 'False' if it doesn't meet either of these conditions.

Using this rule, I will now label the objects in Group 1:
- large green triangle -> True (because it is green and a triangle)
- small green rectangle -> True (because it is green)
- medium green rectangle -> True (because it is green)
- small yellow triangle -> True (because it is a triangle)
- small blue triangle -> True (because it is a triangle)"

-medium green circle -> True
-medium blue triangle -> False
-medium yellow circle -> False"
57,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,medium yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is based on the combination of object color and shape. The true labels are assigned to green circles and blue rectangles only, regardless of their size. All other combinations of color and shape are labeled false.

Now, let's apply this rule to Group 20:

58,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,large blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to revolve around a specific combination of attributes. An object is labeled 'True' if it is both small and either a green circle or a blue rectangle. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Label for the object in Group 21:
-large blue triangle -> False"
59,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that an object must be a small green circle or either a small blue rectangle or a medium blue rectangle, regardless of the group it is in. All other objects should be labeled 'False', regardless of their color, size, shape, or the group they belong to.

Label for the object in Group 22:
-large yellow rectangle -> False"
60,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,small blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' appears to relate to whether the object is a small blue rectangle. All other objects have been labeled 'False', regardless of their color, size, shape, or the group they belong to. Therefore, the only objects labeled 'True' are small blue rectangles.

64,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends on a combination of the object's size and shape. Specifically, the objects labeled 'True' are small circles, medium rectangles, and small triangles. All other shapes and sizes of objects are labeled 'False'.

Thus, the labels for the objects in Group 24 are:

67,hg110,at least one other object of the same shape is blue,large yellow circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to consider the presence of a particular object in combination within the same group. If a group contains both a medium blue rectangle and another object, both objects are labeled 'True'. Otherwise, the objects are labeled 'False'. Furthermore, a small green triangle or a small blue rectangle is labeled 'True' when appearing in a group without a medium blue rectangle. A large yellow circle is also labeled 'True' when not in the company of a medium blue rectangle. No other object or combination of objects seems to affect the labeling.

Label the objects in Group 25:
-large yellow circle -> True (since it's labeled 'True' when it appears without a medium blue rectangle)
-medium blue triangle -> False (only a medium blue rectangle would trigger a 'True', and the shape here is triangle)
-small green circle -> False (there is no medium blue rectangle in the group to make it 'True', and the rule for small green circles isn't confirmed)
-large yellow triangle -> False (no rule has established a condition for it being 'True')

0,hg107,exactly one blue object that is the same shape excluding this object,medium green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' appears to involve both the shape and color of the objects. The objects labeled as 'True' are green circles, indicating that the shape must be a circle and the color must be green for the rule to apply. However, without examples of other colors or shapes being verified as 'True' or 'False,' the rule can only be deduced from the green circles provided:

-medium green rectangle -> False (because the shape is not a circle)
-medium green circle -> True (because it matches the shape and color of the objects labeled 'True')"

2,hg107,exactly one blue object that is the same shape excluding this object,small yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is currently unclear with the given information, as both objects in Group 1 are labeled 'False' and share multiple attributes (both are medium-sized and green, one is a rectangle, and the other is a circle). However, since we have to label Group 2 with no additional information, I will proceed with the assumption the rule is not based on size, shape, or color alone, as there are no 'True' examples to contradict this.

Therefore, without a clear rule, I can only guess that:
-small yellow circle -> False
-large blue rectangle -> False

Without more information or examples of 'True' objects, it's impossible to determine the secret rule with certainty."

Following this rule, the objects in Group 17 should be labeled as follows:

-medium green circle -> False (green circles are not labeled 'True')
-large yellow circle -> False (yellow objects are always 'False')
-small blue rectangle -> True (small blue rectangles are 'True')
-large yellow triangle -> False (yellow objects and triangles are always 'False')
-medium yellow triangle -> False (yellow objects and triangles are always 'False')"
51,hg107,exactly one blue object that is the same shape excluding this object,medium yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to depend on the size and color of the objects:

- Circles and rectangles are labeled 'True' if they are either blue or green and not yellow. 
- Size appears to only be relevant when it comes to blue objects: small blue rectangles and circles of any size are labeled 'True', but ONLY large blue rectangles are labeled 'True'.
- Yellow objects are always labeled 'False' regardless of their shape or size.
- Green shapes are labeled 'True' only when they are either medium or large rectangles.
- All triangles are labeled 'False', regardless of their color or size.

Following this rule, the objects in Group 17 should be labeled as follows:

-medium green circle -> False (green circles are not labeled 'True')
-large yellow circle -> False (yellow objects are always 'False')
-small blue rectangle -> True (small blue rectangles are 'True')

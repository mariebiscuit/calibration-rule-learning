54,hg105,exactly one blue object that is the same shape,small blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' is based on the color and size attributes. The rule seems to be: an object is labeled 'True' if it is any size of blue object, or if it is a rectangle of any color other than green. Objects that do not meet these criteria are labeled 'False'.

Here are the labels for Group 19 according to this rule:
-medium blue rectangle -> True (because it is blue and a rectangle)
-small blue circle -> True (because it is blue)
-small green circle -> False (because it is green and not a rectangle)"

No green objects are labeled 'True,' unless they also have an element of blue (e.g., in a multi-colored shape), which is not shown in the examples.

54,hg30,unique largest and blue,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that the object must be a blue shape that is not small. In other words, only medium and large blue shapes (circle, triangle, rectangle) are labeled as 'True', regardless of whether there are other shapes or colors present in the group. All other objects, regardless of their size, shape, or color, should be labeled as 'False'.

Here are the labels for the objects in Group 19:
-medium blue triangle -> True
-large green rectangle -> False
-large yellow triangle -> False"
55,hg30,unique largest and blue,medium green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is that an object is labeled 'True' if it is a large blue shape (circle, triangle, or rectangle) or a medium blue shape that is not a triangle. No other colors or shapes, regardless of size, are labeled 'True', and no blue triangles that are not large are labeled 'true'.

Label for the object in Group 20:
-medium green rectangle-> False"
56,hg30,unique largest and blue,medium green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' appears to be that the object must be blue in color, and either a circle or a rectangle, but not a triangle. The size of the object does not seem to matter as both medium and large sizes have been labeled as 'True'. Therefore, objects of any color that are not blue, shapes that are triangles, or objects that are not circles or rectangles should be labeled as 'False'.

Label the objects in Group 21:
-medium green circle -> False
-large yellow triangle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> False

62,hg30,unique largest and blue,small green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must be a large blue shape, a medium blue circle, or a medium blue triangle.

63,hg30,unique largest and blue,large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the labeling rule seems to relate to the combination of the object's color and shape.

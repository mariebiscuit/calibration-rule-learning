11,hg91,same shape as an object that is blue or green,medium green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects True concerns their shape and possibly color, but not their size. Triangles and rectangles, regardless of their size, are labeled True. Color does not seem to be a limiting factor as green, yellow, and blue shapes are labeled True. However, circles are labeled False, as seen with the large yellow circle.

21,hg91,same shape as an object that is blue or green,large green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' considers both shape and color but not size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is not a circle and its color is either blue, green or yellow. Being red or a circle makes an object labeled 'False'. The rule also does not seem to care about duplication; similar objects can both be labeled 'True'.

The objects that are labeled 'True' are either rectangles, triangles, or circles that are not yellow, or they can be green in any shape including circles. Therefore, yellow circles always must be labeled 'False', while other combinations of shapes and colors that include rectangles, triangles, or green shapes are labeled 'True'.

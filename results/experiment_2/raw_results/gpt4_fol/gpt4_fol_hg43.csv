5,hg43,(same shape as a blue object) and circle,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects is currently unclear because all objects in Group 1 have been labeled 'False', regardless of their color, size, or shape.

An object is labeled 'True' if it is a circle, regardless of its size or color. All other shapes, including triangles, rectangles, and any other non-circular forms, are labeled 'False'. This rule is consistent for all groups, as only circles are labeled 'True'.

Labeling objects in Group 21 according to the discovered rule:

-small blue triangle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> False
-small yellow triangle -> False
-small yellow circle -> True"

62,hg43,(same shape as a blue object) and circle,small green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must be a circle. All other shapes, regardless of their color or size, are labeled 'False'. Color and size do not seem to affect whether an object is labeled 'True' or 'False'.

Label for the object in Group 22:

63,hg43,(same shape as a blue object) and circle,large blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling the objects 'True' applies to objects that are both circles and blue, regardless of size. All other objects, regardless of their color, shape, or size, should be labeled 'False'. 

Therefore, for Group 23:
- large blue triangle -> False
- medium blue circle -> True"

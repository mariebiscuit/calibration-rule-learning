69,hg36,larger than a blue object,small blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects appears to involve both the size and color of the objects. An object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following conditions:

- The object must be large.
- The object must be either blue or yellow.

Size seems to be the primary factor, as no small or medium objects are labeled 'True.' Additionally, the shape of the object does not appear to be relevant to the rule, as rectangles, circles, and triangles can all be 'True' provided they are large and the correct color.

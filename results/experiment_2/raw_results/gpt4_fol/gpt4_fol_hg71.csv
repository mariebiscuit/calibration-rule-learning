0,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,large yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' seems to be related to the color and shape of the objects. The rule is that an object must be yellow and rectangular to be labeled 'True'. Other colors or shapes should be labeled 'False'.

4,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,large blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' does not depend on their size or specific shape, but rather on their color. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either yellow or blue, regardless of its size or shape.

-large blue circle -> True"
5,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,large yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' does not seem to depend on color, size, or specific shape since there is a variety of each in the 'True' category for both groups. Shapes that are either medium or large and colors blue or yellow, irrespective of their shape, are labeled 'True'. There are no 'False' labels to provide any counterexamples, so I will proceed with this rule.

-large yellow rectangle -> True
-small blue triangle -> False (because it is small)

10,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,medium blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule considers both the color and shape of the objects, but not their size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue or yellow, regardless of its size and shape. The presence of green objects in the 'True' set does not follow the pattern, so all mentions of green objects being 'True' have been omitted from the rule summary.

-medium blue circle -> True"
11,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,small blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' does not seem to consider size, as all sizes (large, medium, small) have instances of 'True'. It does not consider shape either, as rectangles, circles, and triangles have been labeled 'True'. However, it seems to consider the presence of blue and yellow colors; every object that is blue or yellow is labeled 'True', regardless of its size or shape. No other colors have been shown, so it's possible that objects with any color other than blue or yellow might be labeled 'False'.

46,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,medium blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be based on their color and shape, regardless of their size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue of any shape, or it is any color and has the shape of either a rectangle or a triangle. Circles of colors other than blue are labeled 'False'. Yellow rectangles, regardless of size, seem to contradict this rule based on Group 6, so they are likely labeled 'False'. 

For Group 17:
-large blue rectangle -> True
-medium blue rectangle -> True"
47,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,medium yellow rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule considers both the color and the shape of the objects, but not the size. To be labeled 'True,' an object must be either a blue shape of any kind or a non-blue rectangle. Other colored objects that are not rectangles or blue objects that are not a recognized shape must be labeled 'False'.

For Group 18:
-medium yellow rectangle-> False"
48,hg71,does not exist another object with same shape and color,small blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is based on having at least one attribute (color, size, or shape) in common with any other object within the same group.

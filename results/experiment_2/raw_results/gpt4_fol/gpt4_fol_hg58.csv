1,hg58,same shape as one of the largest and blue,small yellow triangle,False,None,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' has not been demonstrated with enough information. With only one object labeled from Group 1 (medium green circle -> False), I cannot deduce a pattern or rule that governs the labeling system.

However, without additional examples or labels, it is impossible to accurately label the objects in Group 2. Thus, I cannot provide labels for the following objects without guessing:

-small yellow triangle -> ?
-small green triangle -> ? 

More information or examples would be needed to establish a rule and label the objects correctly."

58,hg58,same shape as one of the largest and blue,medium green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' depends on both color and shape: only blue objects that are either rectangles, circles, or triangles are labeled 'True'. No object with any other color or shape (like yellow or green objects, or any other non-blue object) qualifies to be labeled 'True'. Size does not seem to affect an object's label.

Labels for objects in Group 21:

61,hg58,same shape as one of the largest and blue,small blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves both color and shape: all objects that are blue and are either circles or rectangles are labeled 'True', regardless of their size. Objects with any other combination of features are labeled 'False'.

Label for the object in Group 22:
-small blue circle -> True"
62,hg58,same shape as one of the largest and blue,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is based on their color and shape: blue shapes and circles are labeled 'True', regardless of their size.

66,hg58,same shape as one of the largest and blue,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is related to both the color and the shape of the object. An object is labeled 'True' if it is blue and its shape is either a circle or rectangle. All other combinations of colors and shapes are labeled 'False'.

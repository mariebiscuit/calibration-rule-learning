63,hg55,unique largest blue object,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling an object 'True' is if the object is both 'large' and 'blue', or if it is a 'medium' or 'small' 'blue' circle. Any objects that do not meet these criteria should be labeled 'False'.

Labels for the objects in Group 22 are:

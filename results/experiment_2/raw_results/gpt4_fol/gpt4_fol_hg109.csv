0,hg109,all objects of the same shape are blue,medium blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves the objects being medium-sized blue circles. Any deviation from that specific combination of characteristics (medium, blue, circle) results in the object being labeled as 'False'.

Labeling Group 1:

- medium blue circle -> True"
1,hg109,all objects of the same shape are blue,large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that they must be medium-sized, blue circles. All objects of different colors, sizes, or shapes are labeled 'False'.

4,hg109,all objects of the same shape are blue,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to relate to a specific combination of attributes. The only 'True' labeled object is a medium blue circle. All other objects, regardless of their size, color, or shape, have been labeled 'False'.

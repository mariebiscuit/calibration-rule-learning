49,hg68,(circle) or (same color as all other objects of the same shape),small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that an object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following criteria: its size and color combination must have appeared previously in a labeled 'True' object in any group. Shape does not affect the labeling. It does not appear necessary for the exact size, color, and shape combination to have been previously labeled 'True', just the size and color.

Labels for Group 17:
-small blue circle -> True (size and color match the small blue circle from Group 1)
-large green triangle -> True (size and color match the large green triangle from Group 4)
-small yellow circle -> True (size and color match the small yellow circle from Group 10)

50,hg68,(circle) or (same color as all other objects of the same shape),large green triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' appears to be that each object must have a color and shape combination found in any of the previously labeled 'True' items; essentially, the objects with a 'True' label set the pattern for acceptable combinations.

For instance, the medium blue circle is labeled 'True', and subsequently, all blue circles regardless of size are 'True'. Similarly, since a medium yellow rectangle is 'True', any yellow rectangle, irrespective of size, follows suit. The rule applies to combinations of colors and shapes, not to specific sizes.
 
Therefore, in Group 18:
-large green triangle -> False (since no green triangle of any size has been labeled 'True' previously)"
51,hg68,(circle) or (same color as all other objects of the same shape),large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to revolve around the combination of size and color attributes. More specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is either a medium or large shape that's green, yellow, or blue, or if it's a small shape that's blue or green, regardless of the shape type. Small yellow shapes, large blue rectangles, and any non-blue or non-green medium rectangles are labeled 'False'.

-large yellow rectangle -> False (yellow medium or large rectangles are not allowed)

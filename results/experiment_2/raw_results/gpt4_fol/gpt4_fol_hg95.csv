- large blue rectangle -> False"
1,hg95,the unique element and is (blue and circle),medium blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' is not clear with only one labeled object provided in Group 1. With the available information being just a large blue rectangle labeled as 'False', I cannot deduce a definitive pattern or rule that applies to size, color, or shape nor how they relate to other objects in the group.

However, given that I have no basis to determine the rule, I will label all objects in Group 2 as 'False', following the provided example:

-medium blue rectangle -> False
-large green triangle -> False
-small green circle -> False

Without further examples or additional information, this is the most consistent approach I can take."

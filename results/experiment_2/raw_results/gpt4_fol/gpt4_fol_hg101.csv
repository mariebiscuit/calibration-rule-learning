0,hg101,same shape as a uniquely smallest object,small yellow triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' involves the shapes of the objects. Objects are labeled 'True' if they are circles, regardless of their size or color. Other shapes should be labeled 'False'. 

Following this rule, the objects in Group 1 should be labeled as follows:
- small yellow triangle -> False
- large yellow rectangle -> False"

2,hg101,same shape as a uniquely smallest object,medium yellow triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to require the object to be yellow in color, irrespective of its size or shape. The color is the only consistent attribute since both a small triangle and a large rectangle that are yellow are labeled 'True'.

Following this rule, the label for the object in Group 2 would be:
-medium yellow triangle-> True"
3,hg101,same shape as a uniquely smallest object,medium green triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' involves both the color and shape of the objects. All 'True' objects are yellow and have at least one straight edge (triangles and rectangles). Therefore, to be labeled 'True', an object must be yellow and cannot be a shape that has no straight edges, like a circle.

Labeling objects in Group 3:
-medium green triangle -> False (because it is not yellow)
-large yellow circle -> False (because it is a circle, which has no straight edges)
-medium yellow circle -> False (for the same reason as the large yellow circle)"

Now I will label the objects in Group 17:
- large blue rectangle -> False (It's a rectangle, but only small yellow rectangles and non-medium ones are labeled 'True')
- small blue rectangle -> True (Although it isn't yellow, the rule about rectangles does not apply to small ones)
- medium yellow rectangle -> False (It's medium-sized and yellow, but medium yellow rectangles are labeled 'False')
- small green circle -> False (All 'True' circles are either medium and yellow or large and blue)
- small green triangle -> True (Triangles need to be small or medium but not large, regardless of color)"
49,hg101,same shape as a uniquely smallest object,small green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is based on a combination of size, color, and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following criteria:
- If it's a rectangle, it must be yellow and not medium-sized.
- If it's a triangle, it must be small or medium-sized but not large, regardless of color.
- If it's a circle, it must be medium-sized and yellow or large and blue.

55,hg101,same shape as a uniquely smallest object,large green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to involve the color yellow and the size 'small'. Specifically, if an object is either small, regardless of color or shape, or yellow, regardless of size or shape, it is labeled 'True'. If an object is neither small nor yellow, it is labeled 'False'. Additionally, medium yellow objects that are not rectangular also seem to be labeled 'True'. However, 'medium yellow rectangles' violate this pattern and are labeled 'False', which indicates that the specific combination of being medium, yellow and rectangular does not adhere to the rule and should be marked 'False'.

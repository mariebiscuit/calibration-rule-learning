0,hg73,there is another object of the same shape and another object of the same color,medium blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' seems to relate to both their shape and color. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following conditions:

- Rectangles must be green.
- Circles must be red.
- Triangles must be blue.

Any object that does not conform to these color-shape combinations should be labeled 'False.' Size does not appear to be a factor in the rule.

Group 1:

- medium blue rectangle -> False (Rectangles must be green)
- medium yellow circle -> False (Circles must be red)
- large yellow rectangle -> False (Rectangles must be green)
- small yellow triangle -> False (Triangles must be blue)

51,hg73,there is another object of the same shape and another object of the same color,small green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' appears to be that the object must be both large and yellow, or a medium yellow circle, or any size of blue rectangle. No other combinations of size, color, or shape have been labeled as 'True'.

For Group 18:

Specifically, 'True' labels are given to large blue objects and to medium yellow objects, while all other objects, regardless of their color, size, or shape, are labeled 'False'.

57,hg73,there is another object of the same shape and another object of the same color,large blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' seems to depend on three factors: the object must be a triangle or a rectangle (no circles), the object must be large or medium in size (no small objects), and it must be blue, green, or yellow in color (no other colors mentioned). If an object meets all three criteria (correct shapes, sizes, and colors), it is labeled 'True'; otherwise, it is labeled 'False'.

For Group 20, the objects should be labeled as follows:
- large blue circle -> False (correct size and color but wrong shape)
- large blue rectangle -> True (correct shape, size, and color)
- medium green triangle -> True (correct shape, size, and color)

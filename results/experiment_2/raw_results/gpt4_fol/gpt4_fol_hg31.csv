All 'True' labeled objects are blue and are either triangles or rectangles. Therefore, any object that is not blue or is a circle regardless of its color is labeled 'False'. 

Now, I will label the objects in Group 18 according to this rule:

True labels are only given to blue-colored objects or yellow circles. However, medium-sized yellow circles are labeled False, suggesting that the size in combination with the shape and color is a factor for being labeled True. Consequently, any blue object that is not a medium rectangle is labeled True, and any size of yellow circles except for medium ones is labeled True.

The rule seems to be: an object is labeled 'True' if it is blue and either a rectangle, a triangle, or a circle. No green or yellow objects have been labeled 'True,' and rectangles, triangles, or circles that are blue have consistently been labeled 'True.'

Now, let's label the objects in Group 21:

75,hg31,blue or larger than all other objects,large yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' or 'False' appears to be based on a combination of the object's color and shape. It seems that an object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following criteria:

1. The object should be blue.
2. If it is a circle or a rectangle, it can be any size.
3. If it is a triangle, it should be neither large nor medium but can be small.

Every object labeled 'True' is blue and meets the above shape-size criteria, while every object labeled 'False' either is not blue or does not meet the shape-size criteria if it is blue.

Now, for the objects in Group 23:
- large yellow circle -> False (because it is not blue)
- medium blue triangle -> True (because it is blue and a triangle of an unspecified size, but since small blue triangles are true, it can be assumed that medium ones are also true if not stated otherwise)"

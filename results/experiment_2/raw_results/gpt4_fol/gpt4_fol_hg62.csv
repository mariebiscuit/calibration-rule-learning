1,hg62,blue and same shape as another object,medium yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is currently not possible to determine with certainty from the single example provided. The large blue triangle has been labeled as 'False', but without additional examples or objects contrasting this with a 'True' label, I cannot deduce the specific characteristics (color, size, shape, or a combination of these) that define the rule.

Given the missing information, I cannot accurately label the objects in Group 2. However, to proceed with the task:

-medium yellow rectangle -> False (arbitrary label due to lack of rule)
-large yellow triangle -> False (arbitrary label due to lack of rule)

8,hg62,blue and same shape as another object,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is probably related to both the color and the shape of the objects.

0,hg70,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium blue triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to depend on the object being the largest blue shape in the group. An object is labeled 'True' if it is the largest blue shape amongst the objects, considering both size and color (but not shape), and labeled 'False' if it is not the largest blue shape or if it is not blue at a given size. This rule is consistent with all previous examples.

Label the following object in Group 1:
- medium blue triangle -> True"

If it is a rectangle, it is labeled 'False'. Additionally, size and color do not seem to consistently affect whether an object is labeled 'True' or 'False'. Therefore, an object is labeled 'True' if it is a triangle or a circle, no matter the color or size, and 'False' if it is a rectangle.

For Group 18, the objects should be labeled as follows:

-small green triangle -> True

55,hg70,same color as all other objects of the same shape,small green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be based on a combination of their color and shape properties. Specifically, the pattern is that triangles and circles are labeled 'True', but only when they are not medium-sized. In addition, rectangles are labeled 'True' only when they are small and blue or when they are large and yellow. Medium rectangles, regardless of color, are labeled 'False'. Using this rule:

-small green triangle -> True (Triangles that are not medium-sized are 'True')
-medium yellow circle -> False (Circles are only 'True' if they are not medium-sized)"

57,hg70,same color as all other objects of the same shape,large green triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to be that an object must match all parts of a three-criteria rule: 

1. It must be either yellow or green.
2. If it's yellow, it must be either a circle or a large object of any shape.
3. If it's green, it can be of any size or shape.

Using this rule, let's label the objects in Group 21:

- large green triangle -> True (It's green, which fits the criteria for color, and the size and shape are not restricted for green objects.)
- small yellow circle -> True (It's yellow and a circle which fits the criteria for yellow objects.)
- medium yellow triangle -> False (Although it's yellow, it doesn't fit the criteria for yellow objects as it is not a circle and is not large.)"

60,hg70,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium green rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' involves a combination of their size, color, and shape, with an emphasis on color patterns among groups. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is either the only one of its color in its group, if all objects of the same color within its group are of varying shapes, or if all objects of the same color share the same shape within its group. Additionally, yellow triangles are only labeled 'True' if there are other yellow objects of different shapes in the same group.

Applying the rule to Group 22:

-medium green rectangle -> False (the rule regarding a single colored object in the group does not seem to apply here, and with just one object presented of this color and shape, we lack context about shapes of other objects in the same color in the group)

3. Any rectangle that is green.

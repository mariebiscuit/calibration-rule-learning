52,hg76,every other object   shares at least one feature  with this object,medium yellow triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' requires an object to be both medium-sized and green or have a yellow color, regardless of shape, or it must be either a small blue triangle or a small blue circle. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Applying this rule to Group 18:

54,hg76,every other object   shares at least one feature  with this object,medium yellow triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' involves both color and size. The criteria seem to be:

- The object must be either blue or yellow.
- If the object is blue, it must be either medium or large.
- If the object is yellow, it must only be medium.
- Circles and triangles are considered, while rectangles are not.

Now, to label the objects in Group 19:

-medium yellow triangle -> False, because although it is yellow, the rule does not apply to triangles.
-small yellow rectangle -> False, because it is not medium."

56,hg76,every other object   shares at least one feature  with this object,large blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the correct label is determined by both the color and size of the objects, with a few exceptions. The rule appears to be:

- Medium-sized objects are labeled 'True' if they are circles or triangles.
- Small triangles and circles of any color are labeled 'True', except for green triangles and green circles which are 'False'.
- Small rectangles are labeled 'True' if they are yellow.
- Large yellow circles are labeled 'True'.
- Large triangles are 'True' regardless of color.

Other shapes and colors, or sizes not meeting these criteria are labeled 'False'. This rule seems to be consistent with the labeling of objects in all the groups provided.

Labeling objects in Group 20:

- large blue circle -> False (Not a triangle, and the rule for circles being 'True' is specific to medium size or large yellow)
- large blue rectangle -> False (All rectangles that have been labeled 'True' were either medium yellow or small yellow.)"

Additionally, circles and triangles can both be 'True', but rectangles and other shapes are always 'False' regardless of their size or color.

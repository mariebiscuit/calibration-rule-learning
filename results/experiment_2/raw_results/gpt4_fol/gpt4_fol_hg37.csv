59,hg37,same shape as a blue object,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is based on a combination of shape and color. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a small circle or any size triangle, provided that the color is blue or yellow. Objects of other shapes, sizes, or colors that don't fit this criteria are labeled 'False'.

For Group 21:

-small green rectangle -> False (it is green and not a blue/yellow triangle or small circle)
-small yellow rectangle -> False (despite being yellow, it's not a triangle or small circle)"
60,hg37,same shape as a blue object,small green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects takes into account both the shape and color of the objects. An object is labeled as 'True' if it is either a triangle of any size and any color, or if it is a blue circle of any size. All other objects, regardless of their size or shape, are labeled 'False'.

Labels for the objects in Group 22:

63,hg37,same shape as a blue object,large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' or 'False' seems to be based on the following criteria:

An object is labeled 'True' if it is a triangle of any size or color, a blue object of any size and shape, or a yellow circle that is small in size. All other objects, regardless of their shape, color, or size, are labeled 'False'.

Applying this rule to Group 23:

-small yellow triangle -> True (it is a triangle)
-small yellow rectangle -> False (it is not a triangle, not blue, and not a small yellow circle)

All yellow and green objects, or objects of any other colors, have been labeled 'False', as well as any shapes that are not one of those specified for blue objects.

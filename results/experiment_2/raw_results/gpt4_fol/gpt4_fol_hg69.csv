0,hg69,all objects of this shape are blue,medium yellow circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects seems to be related to the color and shape of the objects. An object is labeled as 'True' if it is a yellow circle, regardless of its size. All other combinations of shapes and colors are labeled as 'False'.

Following this discovered rule, here are the labels for the objects in Group 1:

- medium yellow circle -> True
- large blue rectangle -> False"
1,hg69,all objects of this shape are blue,large blue rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects seems to be related to the color and shape of the objects. An object is labeled as 'True' if it is a yellow circle, regardless of its size. All other combinations of shapes and colors are labeled as 'False'.

2,hg69,all objects of this shape are blue,medium green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves them being both large and rectangles, regardless of color. The color and shape (circle) of the medium yellow circle does not matter; since it's not large and not a rectangle, it was labeled 'False'. The large blue rectangle meets both criteria—being large and a rectangle—so it was labeled 'True'.

Applying this rule to Group 2:

- medium green rectangle -> False (because it is not large)
- medium yellow rectangle -> False (because it is not large)"
3,hg69,all objects of this shape are blue,medium yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves them being both large and rectangles, regardless of color. The color and shape (circle) of the medium yellow circle does not matter; since it's not large and not a rectangle, it was labeled 'False'. The large blue rectangle meets both criteria—being large and a rectangle—so it was labeled 'True'.

- medium yellow rectangle -> False (because it is not large)"
4,hg69,all objects of this shape are blue,medium green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule may be related to both shape and color of the objects since size doesn't seem to be a consistent indicator (medium objects are both true and false). Color might not be the defining factor either since we have yellow being false in both instances. However, the only 'True' labeled object is a blue rectangle, which is also the only rectangle and the only blue object.

Given this information, the most consistent rule across the examples might be that an object is labeled 'True' if it is both blue in color and a rectangle in shape.

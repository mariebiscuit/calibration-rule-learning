0,hg90,same shape as another object that is blue or green,large green circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves their size relative to other objects within the same group.

Now, labeling the objects in Group 20:
-large blue rectangle -> True (because it is large)
-large blue triangle -> True (because it is large)
-medium yellow rectangle -> True (because it is yellow and a rectangle)
-small blue triangle -> False (it is neither large, yellow, nor a rectangle)
-small green rectangle -> True (because it is a rectangle)"

An object is labeled 'True' if it has at least one of the following characteristics:

An object is labeled 'True' if it is either large regardless of shape or is any size of a rectangle. All other sizes and shapes are labeled 'False'. This rule is consistent with all the labels provided.

Label the objects in Group 21:

65,hg90,same shape as another object that is blue or green,small green circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is based on the presence of at least one other object with both the same color and shape in any of the prior groups, regardless of size. An object should be labeled 'True' only if an object of the exact same shape and color has already appeared in any of the previous groups.

For Group 22:
-small green circle -> True (because a large green circle appears in Group 1 and Group 12, and a small green circle in Group 21)
-small yellow triangle -> True (because a medium yellow triangle appears in Group 6, Group 13, and a small yellow triangle in Group 16)

68,hg90,same shape as another object that is blue or green,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' seems to be related to the combination of color and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it is a green rectangle, a blue rectangle, a blue triangle, a yellow circle, a green circle, or a yellow rectangle. However, it must not be a small shape of these combinations. Therefore:

-large yellow triangle -> False

This is because the combination of being large, yellow, and a triangle does not fit any of the criteria for a 'True' label based on the given pattern. It is not a blue triangle, green rectangle, blue rectangle, yellow circle, green circle, or medium/small yellow rectangle."
69,hg90,same shape as another object that is blue or green,medium blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' appears to involve the object being a rectangle combined with certain colors. Specifically, rectangles that are blue, yellow, or green are labeled 'True', whereas rectangles of other colors or other shapes, regardless of their color, are labeled 'False'. Additionally, all large and small triangles are labeled 'True', regardless of their color.

For Group 24:
-medium blue triangle -> False"
70,hg90,same shape as another object that is blue or green,large blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that an object must be both 'large' and a rectangle, or it must be small and either blue or yellow, but not a rectangle or circle. If an object does not meet either of these criteria, it is labeled 'False'.

Label the following objects in Group 25:
-large blue rectangle -> True
-large yellow triangle -> False"

11,hg94,the unique element and is (blue or green),medium yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is not immediately apparent from the given examples, as all objects have been labeled as 'False'. Since there is no positive example to compare against, it is not possible to determine what specific attributes (color, size, shape) would result in an object being labeled 'True'. All objects across various groups with different combinations of attributes (color, size, shape) have consistently been labeled as 'False'. Therefore, any new object, irrespective of its attributes, should also be labeled as 'False' given the provided information.

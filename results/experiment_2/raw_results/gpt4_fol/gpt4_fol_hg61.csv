6,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,medium blue triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule likely involves both the color and shape of the objects. The rule appears to be that an object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue of any shape and size or if it is a rectangle of any size and color.

According to this rule, the labels for the objects in Group 3 should be:
-medium blue triangle -> True
-large blue triangle -> True

10,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,small blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is that they must be either blue in color, regardless of size and shape, or a green rectangle, regardless of size. Other shapes that are green are labeled 'False'.

For Group 4:
-small blue circle -> True"
11,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be dependent on the color of the objects. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue or green, regardless of its size or shape. Objects with any colors other than blue or green are not provided, so the rule doesn't account for them. However, since no yellow objects have been labeled yet with either 'True' or 'False', it's slightly speculative but consistent with the given data to assume non-blue/green objects would be labeled 'False'.

Labeling for Group 5:
-large yellow triangle -> False"
12,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,large green rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects true or false seems to be based on the shape of the object and its color, but not on its size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is any shape that is either blue or green. The only false objects in the examples are a green triangle and a yellow triangle, which suggests that triangles are the exception unless they are blue or green (the green triangle in Group 1 may have been erroneously labeled as False, as it does not fit with the consistency of the rule observed with other green items). Yellow objects are labeled 'False' regardless of their shape or size, as seen with the large yellow triangle in Group 5. 

Given this rule:

-large green rectangle -> True"
13,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' involves both color and shape: an object is labeled 'True' if it is blue in color or if it is any color triangle. An object is labeled 'False' if it does not meet these criteria (i.e., it is not blue and it is not a triangle).

Labeling for Group 7:
-large yellow rectangle -> False (not blue and not a triangle)
-small blue triangle -> True (blue and a triangle)
-medium green triangle -> True (a triangle)
-small yellow triangle -> True (a triangle)"

22,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,small blue triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to be dependent on color and shape: All triangles and circles are labeled 'True' regardless of their color or size, while rectangles are only labeled 'True' if they are blue or green, but not yellow. Size does not seem to affect the labeling of triangles and circles, but for rectangles, only blue and green ones have been labeled as 'True' in your examples, so the size of rectangles is irrelevant as long as they are not yellow.

58,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,medium green circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to be that the object must be either blue or a triangle, regardless of its size. Objects that are neither blue nor triangle shapes are labeled 'False'. Green circles are an exception to this rule and are also labeled 'True'.

For Group 23:
-medium blue rectangle -> True (because it is blue)
-small green rectangle -> False (it is neither blue nor a triangle)
-medium green circle -> True (green circles are an exception)"
59,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must not be yellow in color. All 'True' labeled objects are of colors other than yellow, while the 'False' labels are consistently applied to yellow objects or to green rectangles that are incorrectly labeled as other forms (most likely user error). Size and shape do not seem to affect whether an object is labeled 'True' or 'False.'

Using this rule to label the objects in Group 24:

-small yellow triangle -> False
-medium yellow rectangle -> False
-large green circle -> True"

62,hg61,blue or same shape as another object,medium yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to depend on the combination of color and shape, regardless of size. Specifically, the rule appears to be that any blue object or any triangle is labeled 'True,' whereas objects with other colors (green, yellow) are labeled 'False' unless they are triangles. Additionally, circles are labeled 'True' when they are blue or green, but not when they are yellow. Rectangles are only 'True' when they are blue or green.

For Group 25:
-medium yellow circle -> False (it is yellow and not a triangle)
-medium blue circle -> True (it is blue)"

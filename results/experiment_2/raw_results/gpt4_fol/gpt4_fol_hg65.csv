4,hg65,same shape and color as another object,large blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' remains unclear, as all objects in Group 1 have been labeled 'False'. Therefore, without additional information or examples of 'True' objects, I cannot deduce a specific rule. However, based on the given data, I must label the object in Group 2 as follows:

-large blue rectangle -> False

8,hg65,same shape and color as another object,medium green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule isn't clearly defined by shape, size, or color alone since there are no 'True' labels in any of the provided groups.

For Group 4:

Without additional information or examples of 'True' labels, the safest assumption is to label any new object as 'False' based on the given examples."
9,hg65,same shape and color as another object,small green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that none of the objects in groups 1-4 are labeled 'True,' suggesting that perhaps a characteristic or a combination of characteristics that are not present in any of the given objects is required for the label 'True'.

All other objects should be labeled 'False' regardless of their color, size, or shape. The size of the green circle does not seem to matter, as both small and medium green circles have been labeled 'True'. No other attributes or combinations have resulted in a 'True' label.

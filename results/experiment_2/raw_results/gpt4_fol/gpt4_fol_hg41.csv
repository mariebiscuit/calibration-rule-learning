58,hg41,green or same shape as a blue object,large blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be that the object must not be a yellow circle or a triangle of any size or color. Every object labeled 'True' is neither a yellow circle nor a triangle. Meanwhile, every yellow circle and triangle is labeled 'False', regardless of their size. Therefore:

Group 19:
-large blue circle -> True
-large yellow circle -> False
-small blue triangle -> False
-large blue rectangle -> True"
59,hg41,green or same shape as a blue object,medium blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be that an object must be anything other than a small yellow circle or a large yellow rectangle, which both consistently are labeled 'False'. All other variations of size, color, and shape have examples that are labeled 'True'. Therefore, the labeling rule appears to focus on excluding these two specific combinations.

For Group 20:
-medium blue circle -> True"
60,hg41,green or same shape as a blue object,medium blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' or 'False' is related to both the shape and the color of the objects. The rule appears to be that all colored shapes are labeled 'True' except for small yellow circles and large yellow rectangles, which are consistently labeled 'False'.

Now, labeling the objects in Group 21:

Now, labeling the objects in Group 21:

62,hg41,green or same shape as a blue object,large blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be related to the color and shape of the objects, disregarding their size. Objects that are blue or green, regardless of their shape or objects that are any color triangle get labeled 'True'. The only shape that doesn't seem to follow the pattern based on color alone are circles. Yellow circles are consistently labeled 'False', but other colored circles are labeled 'True'. Through this rule, objects that are neither blue nor green and are not triangles, except circles, are labeled 'False'.

Using this rule, let's label the objects in Group 22:

-large blue rectangle -> True (because it is blue)
-large blue circle -> True (because it is blue)
-medium green triangle -> True (because it is a green triangle)
-large green triangle -> True (because it is a green triangle)"

For Group 23, the labels should be as follows:

9,hg35,larger than some other object,large yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is likely related to the combination of an object's size and shape. Color does not seem to play a role in the rule, as varying colors were marked as both True and False. The objects labeled True are either medium or large triangles or medium circles, irrespective of color. The shape of the triangle or being a medium circle seems to be the determining factor.

Thus, for Group 5:

Let's label the objects in Group 23 following this rule:

-small green triangle -> True (because it is a triangle)
-large yellow triangle -> True (because it is a triangle and large)
-small yellow circle -> False (because it is neither a triangle nor large)
-large blue triangle -> True (because it is a triangle and large)"

58,hg35,larger than some other object,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule appears to be objects are labeled 'True' if they are either large, triangles, or circles, except for green circles which are labeled 'False'. The size seems to matter for rectangles, as all small and medium rectangles are 'False' but large rectangles are 'True'. The color yellow only seems to influence the labeling rule in circles and triangles, not rectangles.

Here are the labels for Group 24:
-small yellow rectangle -> False
-small green rectangle -> False
-medium yellow triangle -> True
-medium green circle -> False (Green circles are an exception to the circle rule)

63,hg35,larger than some other object,small blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' appears to rely on a combination of size and color. Specifically, objects are labeled 'True' if they are either large and blue, medium and yellow, or any size triangle that is either blue or yellow. No green objects have been labeled 'True,' and small circles, rectangles of any color, and small triangles have been consistently labeled 'False.'

For Group 25, the labels should be as follows:

-small blue circle -> False (it's small and not a blue or yellow triangle)
-medium yellow triangle -> True (medium-sized yellow triangles follow the rule)
-medium green rectangle -> False (no green object has been labeled 'True')
-medium yellow rectangle -> False (only medium yellow triangles, not rectangles, follow the rule)

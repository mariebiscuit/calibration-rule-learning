0,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' or 'False' involves identifying if an object is a medium red circle. If an object is a medium red circle, it should be labeled 'True'. All other objects, regardless of their color, size, or shape, should be labeled 'False'.

Therefore, for Group 1:

- medium blue circle -> False"
1,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,large blue rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to involve both color and shape: an object is labeled 'True' if it is a blue circle, regardless of its size.

15,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,large blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' requires that for a shape to be labeled 'True', it must be the same shape and color as at least one other object that has already been labeled 'True'. If an object is unique in color and shape combination compared to objects previously labeled 'True', then it is labeled 'False'.

- A blue circle is labeled 'True' only in medium size, but the large blue circle in Group 6 does not match this description, therefore it is labeled as 'False'.
- No blue triangles have been labeled 'True' in the provided examples, so the medium blue triangle from Group 6, not matching any previously 'True' objects in color and shape, is labeled as 'False'.

17,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,small blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be that the object must be either a color-matching shape-size pair that has previously been labeled true (like the blue circles and triangles, or the yellow and green triangles), or the object must directly continue a pattern of increasing or decreasing size while matching the color and shape of a previously labeled 'True' object (like increasing sizes of triangles). The rule does not appear to be related to absolute size, absolute shape, or absolute color, but rather specific pairs or continuations. 

Applying this rule to Group 7:
-small blue circle -> False (because a medium blue circle was 'True', not a small one)
-medium yellow triangle -> True (because medium yellow triangles have been labeled 'True' before)"

19,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,small blue triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' relies on two criteria: the shape of the object must be either a triangle or a circle, and the color must be blue or yellow. The size of the object doesn't seem to matter, nor does the presence of rectangles or green-colored objects – those are labeled 'False'. The rule does not seem to apply to large blue circles, as they are labeled inconsistently.

Labeling the objects in Group 8 according to this rule:

-small blue triangle -> True (because it's a blue triangle)
-small yellow circle -> True (because it's a yellow circle)"

1. The color of the object: it must be blue or yellow.
2. The object cannot be a circle.

An object is labeled 'True' if it meets both criteria, otherwise, it's labeled 'False'. Now I will label the object in Group 9 following this rule:

-large blue triangle -> True"
22,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,medium yellow triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is based on both the color and the shape of the objects, independent of their size. For an object to be labeled 'True', it must be blue or yellow, and it must be a circle, triangle, or rectangle. Other colors or shapes, such as green objects or objects with shapes that are not circles, triangles, or rectangles, are labeled 'False'.

Labeling for Group 10:
-medium yellow triangle -> True (because it is yellow and a triangle)
-large yellow rectangle -> True (because it is yellow and a rectangle)"

26,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,large green circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that an object is labeled 'True' if it is both the largest of its shape and the largest of its color within its group, or if no other object in the group shares its shape or color, it is considered 'True' by default. An object is labeled 'False' if it is neither the largest of its shape nor color within the group or if there is another object of the same shape or color that is larger.

Label the objects in Group 13 as follows:

Labeling for objects in Group 22 should be as follows:
-large blue triangle -> True
-small blue triangle -> True
-medium green triangle -> True
-medium green rectangle -> True"
55,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,large yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is that they must be either a blue shape of any size apart from a large blue circle, which is always labeled 'False', or the shapes must be triangles or rectangles of any color besides green, or yellow circles and yellow rectangles of any size. Size does not seem to play a consistent role for the non-blue shapes, but green circles and triangles are consistently labeled 'False'.

Now, to label the objects in Group 23:
-large yellow rectangle -> True (yellow rectangles are labeled 'True')
-medium blue triangle -> True (blue shapes that are not large circles are 'True')
-small green triangle -> False (green triangles are labeled 'False')"

58,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,small blue triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be based on the combination of color and shape, specifically, each shape is only 'True' for one of the colors. For example, triangles are 'True' when they are yellow, circles are 'true' when they are blue, rectangles are 'True' when they are yellow or green, and there is no evidence of any 'True' labels for squares:

- Triangles -> True if yellow
- Circles -> True if blue
- Rectangles -> True if green or yellow
- Squares -> No consistent evidence for being 'True'

Now I will label the objects in Group 24:
- small blue triangle -> False (Because triangles are only 'True' when they are yellow)
- medium green circle -> False (Because circles are only 'True' when they are blue)"

60,hg66,same color as all other objects of the same shape,large green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to be that the object must be blue or yellow and match at least one of the following additional criteria: it is large in size, it is a triangle, or it is a rectangle. The objects labeled 'False' do not meet these conditions.

For Group 25:
-large green triangle -> False (because it is green, not blue or yellow)
-large yellow rectangle -> True (because it is large and yellow, and a rectangle)
-large blue circle -> False (because it is not a triangle or rectangle)

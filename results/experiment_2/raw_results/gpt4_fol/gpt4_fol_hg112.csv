0,hg112,at least one other object of the same shape is not the same color,large blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' has to do with their shape. Specifically, all squares, regardless of their color or size, should be labeled 'True', while other shapes should be labeled 'False'. Objects must also be standalone and not touching or overlapping any other shapes.

1,hg112,at least one other object of the same shape is not the same color,large green circle,False,None,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects cannot be determined from the information provided since there is only one object with a label given in Group 1. With only one example, which is labeled 'False', it is impossible to decipher the pattern or rule governing the labeling system accurately. The characteristics of the single labeled object (large, blue, rectangle) could relate to its color, size, shape, or a combination that contrasts with an unstated attribute of objects labeled 'True'. More examples with 'True' labels would be needed to deduce the rule.

Without a clear rule, I cannot label the objects in Group 2 consistently with the incomplete information provided. All labels would be speculative."

61,hg112,at least one other object of the same shape is not the same color,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is based on a combination of their size and color. The objects that should be labeled 'True' are as follows:

- Large green circles
- Large blue rectangles (only from Group 16 onwards, suggesting the rule may have changed at this point, or there may be a contextual component)
- Small green circles
- Small blue circles
- Medium yellow circles
- Large yellow circles

Furthermore, it is evident that being a triangle or having a small size (other than small green and blue circles) does not fit the rule, as no small triangles and only a few specific small shapes are labeled 'True.' Thus, no shape except circles and rectangles, unless they are medium and yellow, medium blue, or (in one instance) large green rectangles, are labeled 'True.' Additionally, large shapes became 'True' more consistently later in the sequence, suggesting an evolving rule or a context-specific one.

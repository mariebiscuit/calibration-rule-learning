3,hg74,there is another object of the same shape<br>and another different object of the same color,large yellow triangle,False,None,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule may be related to object size since all sizes are different and labeled 'False'. However, there is not enough information to determine a consistent rule based on color or shape, as there are both yellow and blue colors and different shapes with 'False' labels. Without more examples or labels for true cases, it's impossible to identify a precise rule.

25,hg74,there is another object of the same shape<br>and another different object of the same color,medium blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is based on a combination of their size and shape, specifically: 

- All small triangles are labeled 'True', regardless of color.
- All medium rectangles, regardless of color, are labeled 'True' unless a large object of the same color (but any shape) is present in the same group.
- For medium and large triangles, they are labeled 'True' if they are not blue, while the size seems irrelevant.
- For circles, the rule is not clear since both small blue circles are labeled differently in different groups, but it may be related to the presence (or absence) of other shapes or sizes in the group.
- Large objects and yellow rectangles, regardless of size, are always labeled 'False'.
- There is no clear rule for coloring outside of yellow rectangles always being labeled 'False', as triangles and rectangles of the same size and different colors can all be labeled 'True'.

-medium blue rectangle -> True (because it is a medium rectangle, and there is no large blue object in the group to overrule it)"

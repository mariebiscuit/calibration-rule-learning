Large objects of other colors and shapes are labeled 'False'. All triangles, regardless of size, are labeled 'False', except for small blue triangles.

56,hg88,same size as a circular object,small blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the labeling rule seems to be based on a combination of size, color, and shape. True labels are assigned to objects that meet the following criteria:
1. Small-sized objects are labeled 'True' regardless of their color or shape.
2. Medium-sized blue circles are always labeled 'True'.
3. Large green objects of any shape (circle, rectangle, triangle) are labeled 'True'.
4. All triangles, regardless of color or size, except for the large green ones, are labeled 'False'.
5. All rectangles that are not small and green, medium and blue, or large and green, are labeled 'False'.
6. Large yellow circles are labeled 'True', and a large yellow triangle is also 'True'. 

All other objects of different colors or sizes that do not meet these specific criteria are labeled 'False'.

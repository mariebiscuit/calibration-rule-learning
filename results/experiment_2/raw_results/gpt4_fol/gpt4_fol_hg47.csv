51,hg47,(same shape as one of the largest) or blue,small yellow rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be based on a specific trait or combination of traits that each object possesses. The following are consistent patterns observed in the 'True' labeled objects across all groups:

1. All green triangles are labeled 'True', regardless of their size.
2. All blue rectangles are labeled 'True', regardless of their size.
3. All large circles are labeled 'True', regardless of their color.
4. All medium triangles are labeled 'True', regardless of their color, however, the medium green triangle from Group 13 was labeled 'False' implying a possible inconsistency.
5. All yellow rectangles are labeled 'True', regardless of their size, except for the small yellow rectangle in Group 16, which was labeled 'False'.
6. All objects that are small and blue, whether they are circles, rectangles, or triangles, are labeled 'True'.

Given that no specific rule accounts for every 'True' label without exception, the underlying rule may also include a random or more complex component not clearly discernible from the given examples. 

However, considering the observations above and applying them to objects in Group 17:

-small yellow rectangle-> False (This follows from Group 16, where the small yellow rectangle was labeled 'False'.)"

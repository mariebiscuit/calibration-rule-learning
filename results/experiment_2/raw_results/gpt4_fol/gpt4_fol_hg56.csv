2,hg56,unique largest (blue or green) object,large green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the objects labeled 'False' do not hold enough information to deduce a definitive rule. There is no pattern established from the given examples since both objects are of the same color and shape, yet both are labeled 'False'. With only false labels and no true examples to contrast, any rule I provide could be incorrect. Nonetheless, without further information or true examples, I'll attempt to create a tentative rule: Objects that are small and blue are labeled 'False'.

-large green triangle -> True (tentatively, as it does not fit the 'small blue' label for 'False')

This rule does not seem to correlate directly with individual attributes like size, color, or shape when considered independently. Instead, it appears to relate to specific combinations since the same objects can be labeled both 'True' and 'False' in different contexts. Given there are cases where the same shape and color are assigned different labels, there may be an unseen variable or contextual clue that is not immediately apparent from the provided data alone. However, with the information given, the discernable pattern suggests the object is labeled 'True' if it is:
- a large triangle of any color
- a rectangle that is either green and small or green and medium.

Based on this rule, let's label the objects in Group 22:
-small green triangle -> False
-large yellow circle -> False
-large green circle -> False

These objects do not match the combinations of attributes that have been labeled 'True' according to the data provided."
56,hg56,unique largest (blue or green) object,large green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' must consider shape, color, and possibly other specific properties being paired.

57,hg56,unique largest (blue or green) object,large green circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that the object must be both green in color and a geometric shape with a number of sides that is either prime (triangle - 3 sides) or a square (rectangle - 4 sides). All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Labels for Group 23:
-large green circle -> True (It's green, and circles are categorized as having an infinite number of sides which satisfies the prime number rule.)
-large yellow triangle -> False (It's not green.)
-medium green triangle -> True (It's green and a triangle has 3 sides, which is a prime number.)"

60,hg56,unique largest (blue or green) object,medium yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to relate to two factors: they must be single-colored items (no mixes of colors are indicated to be true), and they need to satisfy one of the following shape-size criteria:
- Triangles must be large,
- Circles must be large or small, but not medium,
- Rectangles must be medium.

Using this rule:

-medium yellow triangle -> False (triangles must be large to be true)
-medium green circle -> False (circles must be large or small to be true)
-small blue rectangle -> False (rectangles must be medium to be true)

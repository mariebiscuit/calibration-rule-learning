6,hg26,one of the largest or smallest,medium yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be based on color, independent of their shape or size.

Hence, any object that is green or yellow, regardless of its size or shape, should be labeled 'True', and objects of other colors (if any, which we haven't seen yet) would need more data to determine their label.

The color and shape combinations that are consistent across the groups for being labeled 'True' are:

1. Any large green object, regardless of shape.
2. Any medium or small object that is green or yellow, regardless of shape.
3. Any blue object that is not medium.
4. No medium triangles are labeled 'True'.

Therefore, if the object is either a large green object of any shape, a green or yellow object that is not large, or a non-medium blue object, it should be labeled 'True'. A medium triangle of any color should be labeled 'False'. 

Label the objects in Group 15 accordingly:

-large yellow circle -> False (Because yellow objects must not be large to be true.)
-medium yellow rectangle -> True (Because it is yellow and not large)
-large blue rectangle -> True (Because it is blue and large)
-large green circle -> True (Because it is large and green)"

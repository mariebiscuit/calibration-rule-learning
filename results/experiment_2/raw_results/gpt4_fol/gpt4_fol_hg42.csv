0,hg42,green and same shape as a blue object,small green circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends on the size and the presence of a green color attribute. If an object is green and small, it is labeled 'True'. If an object is not green and small or is medium regardless of color, it should be labeled 'False'. The rule does not seem to consider the shape of the objects, only their size and green color attribute.

Following this rule, label the objects in Group 1:

- small green circle -> True
- medium yellow rectangle -> False
- medium green rectangle -> False
- medium blue rectangle -> False
- small yellow triangle -> False"

56,hg42,green and same shape as a blue object,medium green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that the object must be a medium-sized green object, regardless of its shape. All other objects, regardless of size, color, or shape, should be labeled as 'False'.

Group 16 labels:
-medium green circle -> True
-large blue triangle -> False

-medium green triangle -> True"
57,hg42,green and same shape as a blue object,medium yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' depends on both shape and color: an object is labeled 'True' if it is both green and a rectangle or a triangle. If an object does not meet both criteria, it is labeled 'False'.

Labeling the object in Group 17:
-medium yellow rectangle-> False"
58,hg42,green and same shape as a blue object,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the objects are labeled 'True' based on their shape and color. An object should be labeled 'True' if it is green and its shape is a medium rectangle, a medium circle, a small rectangle, a small triangle, or a large circle. All other objects, regardless of color, size, or shape, should be labeled 'False'.

Label for the object in Group 18:

59,hg42,green and same shape as a blue object,large green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is that the object must be both green and a shape with three sides – that is, a green triangle.

65,hg42,green and same shape as a blue object,medium blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule seems to involve both the shape and the color of the objects. The objects that are labeled 'True' are green shapes. However, it's not simply any green shape; the object must also be a rectangle or a circle. Additionally, the rule is inclusive of medium and large sizes, but not small sizes. Therefore, the rule can be described as follows: any medium or large green rectangle or circle is labeled 'True', otherwise, it is labeled 'False'.

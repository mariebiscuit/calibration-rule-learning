0,hg57,same shape as the unique largest blue object,large blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be related to the shape and color attributes. An object is labeled 'True' if it is a blue circle, regardless of its size, or a medium yellow geometric shape, regardless of the specific type of shape. 

Using this rule, I will label the objects in Group 1:

- large blue circle -> True
- small blue circle -> True
- medium yellow triangle -> True
- medium yellow rectangle -> True

All of these objects follow the rule based on their attributes of color and shape as described."

"
52,hg57,same shape as the unique largest blue object,medium blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that the object must be both the largest or smallest size of its specific color and shape combination within its group. If an object is not the largest or smallest of its color and shape combination in the group, it is labeled 'False'. All the objects in a group must be considered together to determine the appropriate labels.

Now, applying this rule to Group 19:

-medium blue circle -> False (not the largest or smallest blue circle in any group)
-large green circle -> False (there is no small green circle to compare it with in this group, and thus it cannot be established as the largest)
-medium green triangle -> False (not the largest or smallest green triangle in any group)
-small green rectangle -> True (it is the smallest green rectangle and there is no other green rectangle to compare it with in this group)
-medium green: there's a missing shape descriptor here, so I can't apply the rule."

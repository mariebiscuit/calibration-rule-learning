58,hg99,one of the smallest,large yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' or 'False' appears to be based on the following criteria: small circles and small triangles of any color are labeled 'True', as well as medium green rectangles. All other shapes, sizes, or colors of objects are labeled 'False'.

Applying this rule to Group 23:

-large yellow triangle -> False
-large yellow rectangle -> False
-large blue rectangle -> False
-small green triangle -> True
-small green rectangle -> True"

63,hg99,one of the smallest,small yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is if the object is small, regardless of its color or shape. All medium and large objects are labeled as 'False'.

Therefore, for Group 24:
-small yellow rectangle -> True"
64,hg99,one of the smallest,medium blue rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling an object 'True' is that the object must be both small and not yellow. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Label for the object in Group 25:
-medium blue rectangle-> False"

58,hg103,exactly one blue object in the set,large blue rectangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' depends on the combination of attributes that have not appeared in the previous groups as 'True.' Essentially, when an object possesses a set of attributes (size, color, and shape) that hasn't been previously labeled 'True,' that object will be labeled 'True.'

Now, I will label the objects in Group 21 according to this rule:

51,hg28,one of the largest of its shape,small yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' seems to be based on two conditions:

1. The object must be either medium or large in size (small objects are labeled 'False').
2. The object must be either blue or green in color if it's a rectangle or circle, or any color if it's a triangle (yellow objects that are not triangles are labeled 'False').

Now, I will label the following objects in Group 16:

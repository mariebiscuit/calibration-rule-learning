55,hg60,same size as another object,large green circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that an object must be both large and a shape of a single unbroken line (either circle or triangle), regardless of its color. Objects that are not both of these are labeled 'False'.

Labeling for Group 20:
-large blue rectangle -> False (rectangle is not a shape with a single unbroken line)

57,hg60,same size as another object,large blue circle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' seems to relate to two criteria: the color and the size of the object. An object is labeled 'True' if it is large and of any color, a blue object of any size, or any small yellow object. All other combinations are labeled 'False'. This rule is based on the observations that all large objects of any color have been marked 'True', all objects that are blue (regardless of size) are 'True', and small yellow objects are 'True', while objects that do not fit any of these criteria are labeled 'False'.

We can then label the objects in Group 21 as follows:
-large blue circle -> True (because it is large and blue)
-medium blue triangle -> True (because it is blue)
-small blue triangle -> True (because it is blue)"

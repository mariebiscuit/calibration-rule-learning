59,hg87,same shape as a blue object,large green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is based on the shape and color combination, specifically that rectangles and circles must be blue, and triangles must be small and blue to be labeled 'True'. All other color and shape combinations are labeled 'False'.

For Group 20:
-large green rectangle-> False"
60,hg87,same shape as a blue object,small yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends on both the size and color of the object. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue of any size, a small triangle of any color, or a yellow rectangle of any size. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

65,hg87,same shape as a blue object,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your example, I've learned that the rule for labeling an object 'True' seems to be that it must have at least one of the following attributes: it is blue, it is small, or it is a yellow circle. All objects labeled 'True' in the provided examples fit this pattern.

Applying this rule to Group 22:
-large yellow rectangle -> False"
66,hg87,same shape as a blue object,small blue triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be related to their color and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it is not green and has any shape, or if it is any color (including green) but has a shape of a rectangle or a circle. Green shapes that are not rectangles or circles are labeled 'False'.

Using this rule, I will label the object in Group 23 as:
-small blue triangle-> True"
67,hg87,same shape as a blue object,medium green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be that an object must be both geometrically symmetrical along at least one axis and also not green. Symmetry is key here, as triangles are not labeled 'True' (they have only one line of symmetry but are asymmetrical in 2D space because they lack rotational symmetry), while circles, rectangles, and squares are symmetrical in both axes. Additionally, none of the green objects are labeled 'True', suggesting that color also plays a role in the rule.

Thus, for Group 24:
-medium green circle-> False (It is symmetrical but is green)
-medium yellow triangle-> False (Not symmetrical in 2D space)
-medium blue rectangle-> True (Symmetrical and not green)
-small blue rectangle-> True (Symmetrical and not green)
-small yellow circle-> True (Symmetrical and not green)"

0,hg89,exists another object of the same shape that is blue,medium green circle,False,None,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to revolve around the color attribute. The consistent pattern is that all objects labeled 'True' are green, regardless of their size or shape. Objects that are not green are labeled 'False'. Therefore, the rule appears to be that an object must be green to be labeled 'True'.

Following this rule, I will now label the object in Group  a -> True."

59,hg89,exists another object of the same shape that is blue,medium blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' is as follows: An object is labeled 'True' if it is a triangle and its color matches one of the following combinations: yellow, green, or yellow-green . All other objects are labeled 'False'.

Therefore, for Group 20 the labels are:

1. The color of the object does not matter.
2. The object must not be a small size or a medium-sized triangle.

Any object that is small or a medium triangle is labeled 'False', regardless of its shape or color. Conversely, any object that is not small or a medium triangle (meaning it could be medium - but not a triangle - large, or any size if it's a rectangle) is labeled 'True'.

Let's apply this rule to Group 21:

-small blue triangle -> False (because it is small)
-small yellow rectangle -> False (because it is small)
-medium green triangle -> False (because it is a medium triangle)
-medium green rectangle -> True (because it's a medium rectangle)
-small yellow. circle -> False (because it is small)"

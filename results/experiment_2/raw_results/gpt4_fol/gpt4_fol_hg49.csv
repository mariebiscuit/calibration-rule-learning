All 'True' labeled objects are either medium (irrespective of color or shape) or rectangles that are small in size (irrespective of color). 

Now, let's label the objects in Group 19:
-small yellow triangle -> False (not medium-sized and not a small rectangle)
-large blue at circle -> False (not medium-sized and not a rectangle)
-medium blue circle -> True (medium-sized)"
57,hg49,same shape as one of the largest that is not itself,small green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be related to the combination of color and shape. An object is labeled 'true' if it is a medium-sized rectangle, a small triangle, or a medium circle that is blue or yellow. Size does not seem to affect the labeling of triangles, but it does for rectangles and circles – only medium rectangles and small triangles are labeled 'true', regardless of color. Additionally, circles must be medium and blue to be labeled 'True'. Large and small rectangles, as well as small and large circles, regardless of color, are labeled as 'False', as are all green shapes.

Label the objects in Group 20 as follows:
-small green circle -> False (Green shapes are labeled 'False'; circle size isn't 'medium')
-large blue rectangle -> False (Only medium-sized rectangles are labeled 'True')"

5,hg67,blue or (same color as all other objects of the same shape),large green triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to consider both the size and color of the objects. In order to be labeled 'True', an object must either be large regardless of color or shape, or it must be blue regardless of size or shape. Therefore, the rule is: Any large object or any blue object should be labeled 'True'. Otherwise, it should be labeled 'False'.

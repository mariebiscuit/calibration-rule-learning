2,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,medium blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects is not entirely clear with only two objects labeled as 'False' in Group 1. There isn't enough information to determine a pattern or rule; both a small yellow circle and a large green rectangle are labeled 'False', which does not provide a distinguishing feature to base a rule on. However, since I'm required to label the objects in Group 2 despite the lack of sufficient information, I have to guess at the rule.

4,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,medium green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects is not immediately clear from the provided information, as there are no examples of an object labeled 'True' to compare against those labeled 'False'. Given the lack of any 'True' examples to identify the secret rule, I am unable to specify the exact rule and thus cannot accurately label the object in Group 3. However, to follow the instruction format:

-medium green circle -> False (due to lack of information about the rule)."
5,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,medium green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule seems to be related to neither the color, size, nor the shape of the objects, as each group includes a variety of these traits and all are labeled 'False'. Since all objects so far are marked 'False', there might not be enough information to determine what would make an object 'True'. It's possible that the rule is related to an unobserved characteristic or context that isn't provided by the objects in these groups.

Therefore, given the lack of any true-labeled objects to identify a pattern, and no further information to determine the rule, I am going to label all objects in Group 4 as 'False' due to the absence of any 'True' examples to infer from.

53,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects seems to be that an object is labeled 'True' if it is the only one of its combination of attributes (size, color, and shape) within its group. If there's another object in the same group with at least one matching attribute (ignoring the other objects in different groups), then it is labeled 'False'.

Let's apply this rule to Group 20:
-medium green triangle -> False (matches color and shape with other medium triangles in previous examples)
-medium blue triangle -> False (the presence of the small blue triangle and large blue triangle in other groups indicate that blue triangles are not unique)
-small yellow triangle -> True (this is the only small yellow triangle amongst all the examples)
-medium blue rectangle -> True (the only medium blue rectangle in all examples was in Group 11, and it was labeled 'True')
-small yellow rectangle -> False (matches color with the small yellow triangle in Group 20 and the small yellow circle in previous examples)"
54,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the labeling rule seems to be based on two criteria:

1. The object must be a triangle shape.
2. The color and size of the triangle determine its truth value: For the triangle to be labeled as 'True', it must be either a medium yellow triangle or a small yellow triangle.

Here are the labels for Group 21 according to this rule:

-large yellow rectangle -> False
-medium yellow rectangle -> False
-large blue circle -> False

58,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,small blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule seems to be determined by the shape of an object and its relative size. Objects that are labeled 'True' are the medium-sized versions of any given shape. Therefore, small and large versions of shapes, regardless of color, are labeled 'False', while the medium-sized versions are labeled 'True'.

Labeling Group 22:

All other combinations have been labeled 'False'. 

Therefore, for Group 23:
-small blue triangle -> False"
61,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,small yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that an object must be medium-sized, have a shape that is not a circle, and have a color other than green.

62,hg48,same shape as one of the unique largest that is not itself,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be based on a combination of the object's size, color, and shape, but it particularly focuses on the object's relationship with the size and color attributes. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is medium-sized and has the same color and different shape compared to the previous 'True' object. It appears that once an object is labeled 'True', the next 'True' object must be medium-sized, have the same color as the last 'True' object but a different shape. For example, after the medium green circle was labeled 'True', the next 'True' labels were on objects that were not circles but medium and green (medium green triangle), followed by a medium green object that was not a triangle (medium blue rectangle), and then by a medium blue object that was not a rectangle (medium yellow triangle), creating a sequence based on color and size but altering shapes. 

Now, I'll label the following objects in Group 25 based on the last 'True' object being a medium yellow triangle:

-small yellow rectangle -> False (since the size is not medium)
-large green triangle -> False (since the size is not medium)
-small green circle -> False (since the size is not medium)
-medium green rectangle -> True (since the size is medium, the color green matches the last 'True' object, and the shape is different)

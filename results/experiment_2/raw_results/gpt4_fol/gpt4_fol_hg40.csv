58,hg40,(not blue) and same shape as a blue object,medium blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be that they must be small and yellow, regardless of their shape, or they must be green rectangles, regardless of their size. All other attributes or combinations result in the object being labeled 'False'.

Given this rule, here are the labels for the objects in Group 20:
-medium blue circle-> False"
59,hg40,(not blue) and same shape as a blue object,large yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves the combination of size and color. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if and only if it is both small in size and yellow in color. Any object that does not meet these two criteria is labeled 'False'.

Labels for Group 21:
-large yellow circle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> True
-large green triangle -> False
-large blue circle -> False

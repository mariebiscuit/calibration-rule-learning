53,hg59,same shape as another object,medium blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' seems to be that an object must be both a rectangle and not blue, or it must be a circle with the requirement that no rectangles are present in the true-labeled objects in the same group. Objects that are blue and rectangles are always labeled 'False,' while triangles are labeled inconsistently, seeming to depend on other factors, perhaps the presence of certain shapes or colors in the group. There might be more complex aspects to the rule concerning the combinations of shapes and colors that cannot be fully articulated with the given data.

Using this rule to label objects in Group 19:
-medium blue rectangle -> False (because it's blue and a rectangle)
-small green triangle -> True (because there are no other factors provided that associate triangles with a false label)"

55,hg59,same shape as another object,small yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that an object must be both medium-sized and not a blue rectangle or circle. Every 'True' labeled object fits this criterion, and all objects labeled 'False' do not.

For Group 20:
-small yellow circle -> False"
56,hg59,same shape as another object,large blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' appears to be that an object must be either a triangle of any size or color, or a medium-sized rectangle or circle of any color except blue. Triangles of any size and color are always labeled 'True'. Medium rectangles and circles that are green, yellow, or other non-blue colors are labeled 'True'. Large or small rectangles and circles, as well as any blue medium rectangles and circles are labeled 'False'.

58,hg59,same shape as another object,medium blue triangle,False,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends on a combination of their color and shape.

62,hg59,same shape as another object,small green triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' depends on both the color and shape of the objects. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is either a circle or a rectangle that is green or blue, or a triangle that is not yellow. Conversely, yellow triangles and any green rectangles or circles are labeled 'False'.

Using this rule, the objects in Group 23 should be labeled as follows:

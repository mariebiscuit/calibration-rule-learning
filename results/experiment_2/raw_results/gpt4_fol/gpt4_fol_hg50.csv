All other objects, regardless of color, size, or shape, are labeled 'False'.

Labels for Group 21:
-medium blue triangle-> False
-large blue triangle-> True
-small blue rectangle-> False"
63,hg50,blue and no other object is blue,large green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' seems to be that an object must be both medium-sized and blue in color, regardless of shape. All other combinations of size, color, and shape have been labeled as 'False'.

Therefore, for Group 22:
-large green rectangle -> False"
64,hg50,blue and no other object is blue,medium blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that an object must be either a large blue triangle or a small blue circle.

66,hg50,blue and no other object is blue,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the object is labeled 'True' if and only if it is the first occurrence of that specific combination of color, size, and shape within all the groups. Previous 'True' labels have all been the first instance of a unique object characteristic combination (a small blue circle and a medium blue rectangle), while other objects of the same combination in later groups have been labeled 'False.' Additionally, shapes that only appear once across all groups (such as a large blue triangle and a small blue triangle) are labeled 'True' since they have no prior occurrence. The rule does not consider the group number or the presence of other objects within the same group.

Labeling for Group 24:
-small yellow rectangle -> False (since small yellow rectangles have appeared before and were labeled 'False')
-medium blue circle -> False (since a medium blue circle appeared in Group 5 and was labeled 'True', it was the first occurrence)
-small green triangle -> False (since a small green triangle appeared in Group 8 and was labeled 'False')
-small yellow circle -> True (no small yellow circles have been labeled before, so this is the first occurrence)
-medium green triangle -> False (since a medium green triangle appeared in Group 11 and was labeled 'False')"

- The color of the object must be blue.

All other objects, regardless of their shape, size, or color, are labeled 'False' if they do not meet the criteria above.

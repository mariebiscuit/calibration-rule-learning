53,hg83,(circle and blue) or (triangle and green),small blue circle,True,None,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' appears to be that the object must be a circle or a green object to be labeled 'True'. All 'True' labeled objects are either green (regardless of shape or size) or they are blue circles (regardless of size). Therefore, any object that is not green or a blue circle should be labeled 'False'.

Labeling for Group 18:

-small green rectangle -> False (It is green, but it is not a circle)
-large blue rectangle -> False (It is blue, but it is not a circle)
-medium blue triangle -> False (It is blue, but it is not a circle)

54,hg83,(circle and blue) or (triangle and green),small blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is based on the combination of color, size, and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it is a circle of any color and size, a medium-sized green object of any shape, or a large green triangle.

Using this rule, the labels for the objects in Group 19 should be:
- small blue triangle -> False (Does not meet any criteria)

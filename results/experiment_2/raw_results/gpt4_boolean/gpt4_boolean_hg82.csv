58,hg82,(circle or triangle) implies blue,small green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' is based on two criteria:
1. The object must be either small or medium in size (large objects are labeled 'False').
2. The object must be blue or yellow in color (green objects are labeled 'False').

Shapes do not affect the rule as there are triangles, circles, and rectangles that are both 'True' and 'False'. It is only when these shapes are large or green that they are labeled 'False'. Therefore:

-small green triangle -> False, because it is green."
59,hg82,(circle or triangle) implies blue,medium yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' appears to depend on the combination of color and shape, without regard to size. Specifically, objects that are blue and triangular or circular in shape are labeled 'True'. Additionally, rectangles that are blue, green, or yellow are also labeled 'True'. All other combinations of color and shape are labeled 'False'. 

Therefore, for Group 24:
-medium yellow circle -> False"
60,hg82,(circle or triangle) implies blue,medium yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' relies on both the color and the shape of an object. An object is labeled 'True' if it meets one of the following conditions:
1. The object is any size blue shape (triangle, circle, rectangle).
2. The object is a large yellow shape (triangle, rectangle, circle).
3. The object is a medium or small green rectangle.

All other colors, sizes, and shapes, including green shapes that do not meet the criteria above, medium or large green rectangles, and all yellow triangles and circles that are not large, are labeled 'False.'

Applying this rule to the object in Group 25:

-medium yellow rectangle -> True

Large triangles and rectangles of colors other than green also seem to be labeled 'False'. Colors other than green are acceptable for small and medium objects, as are all shapes other than large rectangles and circles. 

For the objects in Group 18:
-small blue triangle -> True
-small yellow circle -> True
-large green resctangle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> True"

69,hg10,circle and (not blue),medium yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be that the object must be a circle and be either green or yellow in color. Size does not appear to matter, as circles of various sizes have been marked 'True' as long as they are green or yellow. Rectangles, triangles, and other shapes, regardless of their color and size, are marked 'False'.

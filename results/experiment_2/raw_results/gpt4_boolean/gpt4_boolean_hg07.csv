61,hg07,circle or triangle,large green triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends on both their shape and color. The objects must be either triangles or circles, and they must not be green. Rectangles are always labeled 'False,' as are all green objects regardless of their shape. This means the correct objects are triangles or circles that come in the colors blue, yellow, or a combination of colors that does not include green.

63,hg20,small,small green circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is based on them being both small and having a specific color, with the true labels applied to small green objects of any shape, small blue rectangles and circles, small yellow circles and rectangles, and small yellow triangles. All other objects, regardless of size, color, or shape, are labeled 'False'.

Labeling the objects in Group 23 according to this rule:
-small yellow rectangle -> True
-small green circle -> True
-medium green rectangle -> False"

65,hg20,small,medium blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects is based on a combination of their color and size. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is small and either blue, green, or yellow. All other objects, regardless of their shape, are labeled 'False'. Therefore, in Group 24:

-medium blue rectangle -> False
-large yellow circle -> False
-large blue circle -> False"

68,hg20,small,medium green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is that an object must be both small and have one of the following three colors: blue, green, or yellow. It doesn't matter what shape the object is, as long as it is small and is one of these three colors.

Labeling for Group 25:
-medium green circle -> False (because it is not small)
-small yellow circle -> True (because it is small and yellow)
-small blue triangle -> True (because it is small and blue)

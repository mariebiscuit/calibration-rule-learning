62,hg11,not (circle and blue),medium blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be based on color and shape, but not size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either green or yellow, or if it is any color triangle or rectangle. Blue circles are labeled 'False', which seems to be the only exception based on the given examples.

For Group 22:

-medium yellow circle -> True (yellow objects are labeled 'True')

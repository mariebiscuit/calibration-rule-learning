Therefore, the labels for the objects in Group 24 are:
-medium blue rectangle -> False
-large green circle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> False
-medium yellow rectangle -> False
-medium yellow circle -> False"

71,hg24,small and blue,medium green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that the object must be a small blue shape. All objects labeled 'True' so far meet these criteria (small, blue, and any shape), while all objects that do not meet these criteria are labeled 'False.'

Now, I'll label the objects in Group 25:
-medium green circle -> False
-medium green rectangle -> False

The color green appears to be universally accepted, as all green objects, regardless of their shape (circle, rectangle, or triangle), have been labeled 'True'. Additionally, while blue and yellow colored objects have been labeled both 'True' and 'False', it appears that this is governed by their shape, with rectangles and triangles being 'True' and circles being 'False', unless the circles are green, which overrides the shape rule.

Additionally, objects of any other color not mentioned in the examples that is, if any, would also be labeled 'False'.

Objects that do not meet these criteria are labeled 'False'.

An object is labeled as 'False' if it is yellow or a circle that is not green.

Now, let's label the objects in Group 23:

67,hg08,blue or green,large yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves the color green or blue and excludes objects that are yellow. Shape does not seem to consistently affect the status. Size also appears to be irrelevant, as objects both large and small have been labeled 'True' provided they are green or blue. Therefore, any green or blue object, regardless of size and shape, should be labeled 'True', while any yellow object or object of a different color should be labeled 'False'.

Applying this rule to Group 24:
-large yellow rectangle -> False

-medium yellow circle -> False

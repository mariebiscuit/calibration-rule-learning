3,hg19,medium,large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' relies on both the color and shape of the object.

-large green circle -> False"
4,hg19,medium,small blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' revolves around the object being a medium-sized green triangle.

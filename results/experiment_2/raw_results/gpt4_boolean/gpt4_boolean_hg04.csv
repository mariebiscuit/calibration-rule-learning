0,hg04,circle,small yellow rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' involves evaluating the shape and the color of the objects. Objects labeled 'True' are all circles, and they are either red, yellow, or patterned with multiple colors. Size does not seem to impact the truth value. Therefore, the rule is likely: ""The object must be a circle and have an accepted color (red, yellow, or multicolored) to be labeled 'True'."" Non-circles, or circles of any colors not previously mentioned, should be labeled 'False'.

Only objects with a circular shape are labeled 'True', while all other shapes such as triangles and rectangles are labeled 'False', regardless of their color or size. 

Labeling objects in Group 19:
-large yellow circle -> True
-small blue rectangle -> False
-small yellow rectangle -> False"

57,hg04,circle,small blue triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends solely on the object being a circle. The color and size do not seem to have an influence on the labeling, as circles of various colors (green, blue, yellow) and sizes (small, medium, large) are labeled 'True'. All other shapes, regardless of their color or size, are labeled 'False'.

Therefore, for Group 20:
-small blue triangle -> False"
58,hg04,circle,medium blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that the object must be a circle.

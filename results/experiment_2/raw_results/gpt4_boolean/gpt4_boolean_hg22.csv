Therefore, I cannot establish a pattern or rule without further information. To label the objects correctly, I would need at least one labeled group to infer the rule.

1,hg22,large or medium,medium yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object needs to be a large blue circle. Since there is only one example given and it is a large blue circle, which is labeled 'True', the rule seems to depend on both the color being blue and the size being large.

Labeling Group 2 objects by this rule:
-medium yellow circle -> False (It is not large and not blue)
-small green circle -> False (It is not large and not blue)"

3,hg22,large or medium,large yellow circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' depends on the color and shape of the object, specifically, the object must be a circle and must not be green. Size does not appear to be a factor.

5,hg22,large or medium,large green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling an object 'True' seems to relate to both the size and color of the object.

The shape of the object (circle or triangle) isn't affecting the rule, as both a circle and a triangle can be labeled 'True'.

Now, I'll label the objects in Group 4:

55,hg22,large or medium,medium blue rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is that an object must be neither small nor a circle. All 'True' labeled objects are either medium or large in size, and they are not circles. They can be any color and shape except for small or circle. If an object is a small size, or if it is a circle of any size, it should be labeled 'False'.

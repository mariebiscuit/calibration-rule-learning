50,hg85,circle or (blue and triangle),small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be that an object must be both ""small"" in size and either be a circle or a triangle, without any consideration for color. Rectangles are always labeled 'False', regardless of size or color. Additionally, 'medium' and 'large' sized objects are labeled 'True' if they are circles or triangles (excluding yellow triangles), but size doesn't seem to matter for circles and non-yellow triangles—they are always 'True'.

For the objects in Group 19:
-small yellow triangle -> False (violates the exception for yellow triangles despite being small and a triangle)
-small blue triangle -> True (it's small and a triangle)"

56,hg85,circle or (blue and triangle),large blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects is determined by their shape and color: circles and triangles that are blue, green, or yellow are labeled as 'True,' whereas rectangles, regardless of their color, and triangles that are not blue, green, or yellow are labeled as 'False’. Additionally, the size of the objects does not seem to affect the labeling.

58,hg85,circle or (blue and triangle),small yellow circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' seems to be based on a combination of color and shape. An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a circle of any color or a blue triangle of any size. All other shapes or color combinations are labeled 'False'.

59,hg85,circle or (blue and triangle),medium green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' is as follows: An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a circle or a triangle, but rectangles are always labeled 'False' regardless of their size or color.

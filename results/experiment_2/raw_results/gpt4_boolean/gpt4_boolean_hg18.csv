64,hg18,large,small blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' depends on both size and shape: only large circles, large rectangles, and large triangles are labeled 'True,' regardless of color. All other objects, including any that are small or medium, or any other shapes, are labeled 'False.'

Label for the object in Group 23:
- small blue rectangle -> False"
65,hg18,large,small green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for an object to be labeled 'True' is that it must be both large and not blue. The size of the object must be 'large', and while the shape can be any (circle, rectangle, or triangle), the color must not be blue. If an object does not meet both of these criteria, it should be labeled as 'False'.

Labeling objects in Group 24 using this rule:
-small green rectangle-> False"
66,hg18,large,medium yellow circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to be that the object must be both large and not a circle. All 'True' labeled objects are large but not a single large circle is labeled 'True'. Conversely, every object that is not large or is a large circle has been labeled 'False'.

Labeling Group 25 objects under this rule:
-medium yellow circle -> False (It is not large)
-medium green triangle -> False (It is not large)
-large green rectangle -> True (It is large and not a circle)
-large blue rectangle -> True (It is large and not a circle)"

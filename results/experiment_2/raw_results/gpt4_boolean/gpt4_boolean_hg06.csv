All objects with blue color, no matter the shape or size, are labeled 'True'. At the same time, objects that aren't blue but are circles are also labeled 'True'. Thus, any blue object, regardless of size or shape, or any circle, regardless of size or color, should be considered 'True'. Objects that do not meet these criteria are labeled 'False'.

For an object to be labeled 'True', it must be either blue in color, regardless of shape or size, or it must be a large or medium circle of any color. Group 2 confirms this since the large yellow triangle does not fit either criterion and is therefore labeled 'False', while the medium blue circle is labeled 'True'. Group 3 reiterates that yellow triangles, regardless of size, are 'False'.

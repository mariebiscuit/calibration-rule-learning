52,hg81,blue implies size 1,large green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must either be small or green. Any object that is not small or green should be labeled 'False'.

Labeling the objects in Group 19 accordingly:

54,hg81,blue implies size 1,small yellow circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is based on the color and size of the objects. The shapes do not seem to matter for the label. An object is labeled 'True' if it is any size of green or if it is small and any color except for blue. Large blue objects and medium blue rectangles are labeled 'False'. 

Label the object in Group 20:
-small yellow circle -> True"
55,hg81,blue implies size 1,large yellow triangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that an object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following criteria:

1. The object is green in color, regardless of its size or shape.
2. The object is not green, but it is small and not a large blue shape.

The 'False' label seems to apply to objects that are large and blue, or not green and not small. 

Now, I will label the object in Group 21:
-large yellow triangle -> False"
56,hg81,blue implies size 1,medium blue circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must not be both blue and large at the same time. Any object that is blue must be either medium or small to be labeled 'True', and any object that is large must not be blue. All other color and size combinations are considered 'True'.

Labeling for Group 22:
-medium blue circle -> False
-medium blue rectangle -> False

59,hg81,blue implies size 1,small blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the objects labeled 'True' are either green in color, regardless of their shape or size, or they are any color small objects (circles, rectangles, or triangles).

Labels for Group 23:
-small blue circle-> True"
60,hg81,blue implies size 1,large green triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves both the color and the size, but not the shape. The pattern seems to be that objects are labeled 'True' if they are green of any size, or if they are yellow or blue only when they are small. Large blue objects are consistently labeled 'False'.

For Group 24:
-large green triangle-> True"
61,hg81,blue implies size 1,small green circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' depends on either the color or the size and shape combined:

- All green-colored objects are labeled 'True' regardless of their size or shape.
- All small objects of any color other than green are labeled 'True' regardless of their shape.
- All triangles of any color other than green and size other than small are labeled 'True'.
- Large blue shapes (other than triangles) and medium blue shapes of any kind are labeled 'False'.

Applying this rule to Group 25:
-small green circle -> True (because it is green)
-small yellow triangle -> True (because it is small)
-large yellow triangle -> True (because it is a large triangle that isn't green)
-large blue circle -> False (because it is a large blue shape that isn't a triangle)"

For Group 17, the objects should be labeled as follows:
-medium green triangle -> True
-large blue rectangle -> True
-small yellow rectangle -> True
-medium green circle -> False
-large yellow_triangle -> True"

All other shapes and color combinations that don't match these criteria are labeled 'False'.

0,hg84,(circle or blue) or  (triangle and green),medium blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling objects in groups appears to focus on the presence of a small red shape.

If there is no small red shape present, all objects should be labeled 'False'. 

Since there is no small red shape in Group 1, the medium blue circle should be labeled as follows:

1,hg84,(circle or blue) or  (triangle and green),large green circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects is likely related to their size and shape. Since there is only one example to deduce from, this is a tentative rule, but it appears that a medium blue circle is labeled 'True.'

Thus, the tentative rule could be that medium-sized circles are labeled 'True,' regardless of their color, but this is based on a very limited dataset.

An object is labeled 'True' if it is either blue or green in color and if it is a circle, triangle, or medium-sized rectangle. All yellow objects, large rectangles, and small rectangles or triangles, regardless of their color, are labeled 'False'. Using this rule for Group 19:

-small yellow rectangle -> False
-small green rectangle -> False
-small blue circle -> True
-medium green triangle -> True"
53,hg84,(circle or blue) or  (triangle and green),small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling an object 'True' hinges on two criteria:

1. The object must be blue or green. Yellow objects are consistently labeled 'False'.
2. The object can be any shape - circle, rectangle, or triangle - and any size - small, medium, or large, as long as it satisfies the first criterion.

Applying this secret rule to Group 20:
-small yellow triangle -> False (violates the color criterion)
-medium yellow circle -> False (violates the color criterion)
-large green circle -> True (meets both the color and shape/size criteria)"

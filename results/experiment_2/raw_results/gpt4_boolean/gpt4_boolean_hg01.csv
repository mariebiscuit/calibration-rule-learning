1,hg01,true,small yellow circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule might be that an object is labeled 'True' if it is a medium yellow triangle. However, with only one example to go from, this rule is quite speculative and may not be accurate.

Instead, all objects, regardless of these traits, are labeled 'True'. Therefore, the rule appears to be that all objects belong to the 'True' category regardless of their other attributes.

1. The object is green.
2. The object is a yellow circle.
3. The object is a blue triangle.
4. The object is a yellow triangle.
5. The object is a blue rectangle.

All other objects that do not meet one of these conditions should be labeled as 'False'.

57,hg01,true,large green rectangle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule to label the objects correctly seems to ignore color, but it is based on shape and size. An object is labeled 'True' if it meets one of these two criteria: (1) it is a triangle of any size, (2) it is a small or medium-sized object of any other shape. Large circles and rectangles are excluded from this rule. 

For Group 23, the labels should be as follows:
-large green rectangle -> False (it is large and not a triangle)
-small green triangle -> True (it is a small triangle, which fits the rule)"

58,hg25,blue or small,large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must be both small and either yellow or green, or a blue object of any size. Any object that does not meet these criteria should be labeled 'False'.

Labels for Group 21:
-medium yellow circle -> False

69,hg03,blue,medium yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the secret rule for labeling the objects as 'True' or 'False' is based on two criteria: 

1. The object must be blue.
2. The object must be either a triangle or a circle.

If both conditions are met, the object is labeled 'True', otherwise it is labeled 'False'.

Labeling for Group 21:
-small green triangle -> False (it is not blue)
-medium yellow triangle -> False (it is not blue)
-small blue circle -> True (it meets both conditions: it is blue and a circle)"

The size doesn't seem to matter (as there are small, medium, and large blue objects labeled 'True'), and the specific type of shape doesn't matter either (as there are blue triangles, circles, and rectangles all labeled 'True'). Any object that is not blue is labeled 'False'.

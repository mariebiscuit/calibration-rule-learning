3,hg16,circle xor (not blue),large green rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' does not depend on their color, size, or specific shape, as we have different colors, sizes, and shapes labeled 'True' in Group 1. Since there are no other objects to compare within the group, and no additional information is provided about their potential functions or other characteristics, the rule seems to be that all objects presented in Group 1 should be labeled 'True', regardless of their individual attributes.

As you have provided only a single object in Group 2 without any additional information, I will apply the rule from Group 1 to Group 2:

54,hg16,circle xor (not blue),large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the objects are labeled 'True' if they are either green in any size and shape, or if they are any color besides blue and in the shape of a rectangle or triangle, regardless of their size. The object is labeled 'False' if it is blue and not a circle, or if it isn't green but is a circle or a non-rectangle/non-triangle shape.

For Group 21:
-large blue circle -> False

55,hg16,circle xor (not blue),medium blue rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is based on a combination of their color and shape, but not their size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is green, regardless of the size or if it is a triangle, regardless of the color or size. Any object that does not meet these criteria is labeled 'False'.

60,hg16,circle xor (not blue),large blue circle,True,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' seems to require that the object is either a circle or a rectangle (not a triangle), and it involves the colors yellow or green. Additionally, size does not seem to affect the labeling. To summarize, an object is labeled 'True' if it's a yellow or green circle or rectangle, regardless of size.

Labeling for Group 23:
-large blue circle-> False"
61,hg16,circle xor (not blue),large green circle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' considers the color and the shape of the objects. An object is labeled 'True' if it follows these criteria:

1. The object must be any shape that is green or yellow.
2. If the object is blue, it must be a large circle to be labeled 'True'.

All other objects are labeled 'False'.

Labels for Group 24:
-large green circle -> False (does not satisfy the rule for blue objects and is not a green or yellow shape other than circle)
-small blue rectangle -> False (blue objects must be large circles to be labeled 'True')
-large yellow triangle -> True (it's a triangle and yellow, which fits the rule)
-large receiveangle -> False (blue objects must be large circles to be labeled 'True')"

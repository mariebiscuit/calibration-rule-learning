-medium blue circle -> True (because it is blue regardless of size)
-small blue rectangle -> True (because it is small and blue)
-small green triangle -> True (because it is small)
-medium yellow triangle -> True (because it is a triangle and triangles have not been shown as 'False')
-medium green circle -> False (because it is a medium or large green circle)"
50,hg80,(not blue) implies (not circle),medium yellow triangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is if the object is either a small shape of any color or a blue shape of any size. All large yellow circles and medium or large green circles are labeled 'False'. No other false objects are shown, so these are assumed to be the only instances of 'False'.

Now, applying the rule to Group 16:

55,hg80,(not blue) implies (not circle),medium blue circle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' or 'False' is related to multiple attributes:
1. Circles are only labeled as 'True' if they are blue and not any other color.
2. Triangles of any color or size are labeled as 'True'.
3. Rectangles are labeled as 'True' regardless of their size or color.

This rule is consistent with the labels for all objects provided.

56,hg80,(not blue) implies (not circle),small yellow rectangle,True,True,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' or 'False' is based on the combination of shape and color, disregarding the size. An object is labeled 'True' if it is a triangle of any color, a rectangle or square of any color (referred here as a rectangle since squares are not explicitly mentioned), a blue circle, or a small circle regardless of its color. All other shapes and color combinations are labeled 'False'.

Therefore, the objects in Group 19 should be labeled as follows:
- small yellow rectangle -> True (rectangles of any color are labeled True)
- large green circle -> False (only small circles and blue circles are labeled True)
- small green rectangle -> True (rectangles of any color are labeled True)"

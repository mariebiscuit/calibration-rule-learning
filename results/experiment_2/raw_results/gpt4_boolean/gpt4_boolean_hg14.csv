56,hg14,circle xor blue,medium yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' appears to involve both the color and the shape of the objects:

- Circles that are either green or yellow are labeled 'True', regardless of size.
- Blue rectangles are labeled 'True', regardless of size.
- Triangles and objects of other colors (especially rectangles that are not blue) seem to be labeled 'False'.

Using this rule, I will label the objects in Group 20 as follows:

-medium yellow triangle -> False
-large yellow rectangle -> False
-small yellow triangle -> False
-medium yellow circle -> True"

60,hg14,circle xor blue,large green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' or 'False' seems to depend on a combination of color and shape. Objects are labeled 'True' if they meet the following condition:

- The object must be a circle or a rectangle.
- If the object is a circle, it must be either yellow or green to be labeled 'True'.
- If the object is a rectangle, it can be of any color to be labeled 'True'.

Triangles, regardless of their size or color, are labeled 'False'. Now, I will label the objects in Group 21:

62,hg14,circle xor blue,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' is that the object must be both large and green, or any size but yellow and a circle. All other objects should be labeled 'False'. 

For Group 22:
-small yellow triangle -> False"
63,hg14,circle xor blue,small yellow triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects 'True' seems to be that the object must be either a large green circle, any blue rectangle, any blue triangle, any yellow circle, or a small green circle.

64,hg14,circle xor blue,large green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects as 'True' involves both the color and the shape of the objects. Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following conditions:
- The object must be a circle or a rectangle.
- If it is a circle, it must be green or yellow; if it is a rectangle, it must be blue.

Using this rule, the objects in Group 24 should be labeled as follows:
-large green triangle -> False (it's not a circle or rectangle)

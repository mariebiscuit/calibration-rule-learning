5,hg13,circle and not blue,medium green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule is not based on size, color, or shape individually since there is no consistent attribute within each labeled group. However, since all examples are marked 'False', it's likely that the rule is based on an attribute or combination of attributes not represented among the given objects. Without further examples or a 'True' case, it's impossible to determine the exact rule. Consequently, there's insufficient information to label the objects in Group 3. Without at least one 'True' example to compare, I cannot accurately label the following objects.

62,hg13,circle and not blue,small green rectangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that the object must be a circle. All the objects labeled 'True' are circles, while objects of any other shape (triangle, rectangle) are labeled 'False'. Color and size do not appear to affect the labeling according to the given rule.

For the objects in Group 22:
-medium green triangle -> False

64,hg13,circle and not blue,medium green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that the object must be a small circle. Size (small), shape (circle), and color do not matter, as long as the object is a small circle, it will be labeled 'True'. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Label for the object in Group 23:

65,hg13,circle and not blue,medium green triangle,False,False,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' is that the object must be a circle. All other shapes, regardless of their color or size, are labeled 'False'. Additionally, within circles, only specific color and size combinations are labeled as 'True': medium green, large yellow, small yellow, and large blue circles are labeled 'True'. No other colored circles, regardless of their sizes, have been marked 'True'.

Applying this rule to Group 24:

An object is labeled 'True' if it is either a blue object of any shape, a triangle of any color, a green circle, or a yellow rectangle. All other objects should be labeled 'False'.

Using this rule, let's label the objects in Group 25:

The objects labeled 'False' do not meet these conditions.

For Group 25:

Now, let's apply this rule to Group 25:

It appears that once an object is labeled 'True', the next 'True' object must be medium-sized, have the same color as the last 'True' object but a different shape. For example, after the medium green circle was labeled 'True', the next 'True' labels were on objects that were not circles but medium and green (medium green triangle), followed by a medium green object that was not a triangle (medium blue rectangle), and then by a medium blue object that was not a rectangle (medium yellow triangle), creating a sequence based on color and size but altering shapes.

69,False,0.0,hg36,larger than a blue object,ERROR,"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects appears to involve both the size and color of the objects. An object is labeled 'True' if it meets the following conditions:

- The object must be large.
- The object must be either blue or yellow.

Size seems to be the primary factor, as no small or medium objects are labeled 'True.' Additionally, the shape of the object does not appear to be relevant to the rule, as rectangles, circles, and triangles can all be 'True' provided they are large and the correct color. Now, I will label the objects in Group 25:

-small blue rectangle -> False (not large)
-large blue rectangle -> True (large and blue)
-medium blue circle -> False (not large)",def is_rule(obj):
63,False,0.6984126984126984,hg35,larger than some other object,(large and blue) or (medium and yellow) or ((triangle and blue) or (triangle and yellow)),"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling objects 'True' appears to rely on a combination of size and color. Specifically, objects are labeled 'True' if they are either large and blue, medium and yellow, or any size triangle that is either blue or yellow. No green objects have been labeled 'True,' and small circles, rectangles of any color, and small triangles have been consistently labeled 'False.'

For Group 25, the labels should be as follows:

-small blue circle -> False (it's small and not a blue or yellow triangle)
-medium yellow triangle -> True (medium-sized yellow triangles follow the rule)
-medium green rectangle -> False (no green object has been labeled 'True')
-medium yellow rectangle -> False (only medium yellow triangles, not rectangles, follow the rule)
-small yellow circle -> False (it is small and not a blue or yellow triangle)","def is_rule(obj):

Objects that are neither large nor blue should be labeled 'False'.

Now, I will label the objects in Group 25 based on this rule:

All other objects, regardless of their size, color, or shape, are labeled 'False'. According to this rule, the label for the object in Group 25 is:

75,False,0.72,hg40,(not blue) and same shape as a blue object,(small and circle) or (small and rectangle) and (green or yellow),"Based on your examples, I've learned that the rule for labeling the objects as 'True' is that an object must be a small circle or a small rectangle. Additionally, the color of the object must be either green or yellow. Any object that does not fit these criteria should be labeled 'False'.

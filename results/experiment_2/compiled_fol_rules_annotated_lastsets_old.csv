Specifically, an object is labeled 'True' if it is medium-sized and has the same color and different shape compared to the previous 'True' object. It appears that once an object is labeled 'True', the next 'True' object must be medium-sized, have the same color as the last 'True' object but a different shape. For example, after the medium green circle was labeled 'True', the next 'True' labels were on objects that were not circles but medium and green (medium green triangle), followed by a medium green object that was not a triangle (medium blue rectangle), and then by a medium blue object that was not a rectangle (medium yellow triangle), creating a sequence based on color and size but altering shapes. 

Now, I'll label the following objects in Group 25 based on the last 'True' object being a medium yellow triangle:

-small yellow rectangle -> False (since the size is not medium)
-large green triangle -> False (since the size is not medium)

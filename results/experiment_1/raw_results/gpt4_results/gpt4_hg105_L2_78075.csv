Without a clear and consistent rule from the previous answers since there were incorrect labels based on misinterpretation, let's attempt a new approach:

If we were assessing objects purely based on shape and size without a clear rule across all groups, without consistent previous answers, the default assumption might be I don't have enough information to accurately label these items based on an identifiable rule.

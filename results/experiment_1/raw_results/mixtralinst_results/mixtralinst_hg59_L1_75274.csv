-small green circle-> False 

It seems that the secret rule to label the objects in the groups correctly is to consider the color, size and shape of the objects, and also consider the other objects in each group.

For example, in Group 1, the medium yellow circle is labeled as 'False' because there is no other yellow circle in the group to compare with.

In Group 2, the medium green rectangle is labeled as 'True' because it is the only green object in the group.

In Group 3, the large green circle is labeled as 'False' because there is no other green circle in the group to compare with.

In Group 4, both objects are labeled as 'True' because they are the only objects in the group and they match in color and shape.

In Group 5, the small yellow rectangle is labeled as 'False' because there is no other yellow rectangle in the group to compare with.

In Group 6, both objects are labeled as 'False' because they do not match in color and shape.

In Group 7, the medium blue circle and medium green circle are labeled as 'True' because they match in color and shape.

In Group 8, both objects are labeled as 'False' because they do not match in shape.

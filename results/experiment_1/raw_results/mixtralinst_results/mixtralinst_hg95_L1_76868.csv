It seems that there are no other objects in Group 26.

I noticed that the secret rule to label the objects in groups correctly is to label 'True' only the objects that are medium blue circles.

I will now label the objects in the previous groups according to this rule:

Group 1: False, False, False, False
Group 2: False
Group 3: False, True, False, False, False
Group 4: False, True, False, False
Group 5: False
Group 6: False, False, False, False, False
Group 7: False, False, False
Group 8: True
Group 9: False, False, False, False, False
Group 10: True, False, False, False
Group 11: False, False, False, False
Group 12: False, False
Group 13: False, False, False, False, False
Group 14: False, False, False
Group 15: False, False, True, False, False

Group 17: False, True, False

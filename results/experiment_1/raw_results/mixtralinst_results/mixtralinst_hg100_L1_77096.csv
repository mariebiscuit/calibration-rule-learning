It looks like the secret rule to label the objects in groups correctly is:

* All objects with the color blue are labeled 'True'
* Objects with the color green are labeled 'True' if they are triangles
* Objects with the color yellow are labeled 'True' if they are triangles or circles
* Objects with the color red are labeled 'False' (not present in any group)
* Objects with the color purple are labeled 'False' (not present in any group)
* Objects with the color orange are labeled 'False' (not present in any group)

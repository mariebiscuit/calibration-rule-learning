-medium yellow triangle-> False
-small blue triangle-> True
-small yellow triangle-> True
-medium blue triangle-> True 

It looks like the rule for labeling the objects is:
- If the object is a rectangle, label it 'True'
- If the object is a circle or triangle, label it 'False'

Is this correct?

No, that is not correct. The rule for labeling the objects is:
- If the object is a rectangle, label it 'True'
- If the object is a circle or triangle, label it 'False'
- If the object is a small yellow rectangle, label it 'True'

I apologize for the mistake. Here are the corrected labels for Group 26:
-medium green rectangle-> False
-medium yellow triangle-> False
-small blue triangle-> True
-small yellow triangle-> True
-medium blue triangle-> False",hg100,2,True

The secret rule to label the objects is:

* If the object is a yellow rectangle, label it 'True'.
* If the object is a blue triangle, label it 'True'.
* If the object is a green rectangle, label it 'True'.
* All other objects should be labeled 'False'.",hg100,2,True
